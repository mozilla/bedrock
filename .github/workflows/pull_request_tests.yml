    # NB: this workflow fails on Ubuntu 22.04 (AKA ubuntu-latest) because the
    # browsers are installed from Ubuntu Snaps, and on 22.04 there's currently
    # an issue where FF lacks access to auto-create a profile, so it hangs.
    # However, 20.04 is long-term support (LTS) until 2025: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
