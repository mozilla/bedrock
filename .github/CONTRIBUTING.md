# Info for Contributors

Hi there. Thanks so much for helping us out with mozilla.org! There are a few
things you should know. Most of the things are in the [bedrock docs][bedrock docs].
These docs have a lot of information about how to get your local environment setup
for development, as well as how to format your code and commit messages.
Following these guidelines will very much increase the chances of a pleasant
code-review experience.

## How to Get Started

If this is your first time contributing then we suggest you first
[install bedrock][install bedrock] and then explore the layout of the codebase
a little. This will help you familiarize yourself with the layout of files and
how they relate to different pages of the website.

## Finding an Issue to Work On

The next step is to find an issue or bug to work on. We suggest looking at issues
with the [good first bug][good first bug] and [help wanted][help wanted]
labels. These types of issues should be ready to work on, and contain enough
information to get started.

[good first bug]: https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/labels/Good%20First%20Bug
[help wanted]: https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/labels/help%20wanted%20%F0%9F%91%8B

Once you have found an issue that interests you, it's worth reading through
carefully to make sure that you understand what needs doing, and also to check
that someone else isn't already working on it. If you're unsure about anything,
then questions are always welcome. Mozilla employees are happy to try and help,
but please note they may not always have the capacity to help mentor on more
complicated issues. So please only take on issues where you feel you have an
understanding for what needs doing. Pull requests will be reviewed on a
first come, first served basis.

## How to Ask for Help

If you're having technical difficulties with bedrock then you can ask for help
on [GitHub][github], or alternatively try dropping into the www:mozilla.org
room on [chat.mozilla.org][chat.mozilla.org].
