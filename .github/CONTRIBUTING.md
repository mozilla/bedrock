# Info for Contributors

Hi there. Thanks so much for helping us out with mozilla.org! There are a few
things you should know. Most of the things are in the
[bedrock docs][]. These docs have a lot of information about how to get your local environment setup
for development, as well as how to format your code and commit messages.
Following these guidelines will very much increase the chances of a pleasant
code-review experience.
