<h1>Mozilla Grants</h1>

<p>We want the Web to be even better. We want more people using it for more things. We want it to continue to drive creativity, education and economic growth. And we want to empower people to help shape the Web as they move more of their lives online.</p>
<p>This is why we develop software, launch learning programs, champion privacy and drive standards in the pursuit of our mission to keep the Web open. It's also why we invest in people, organizations, schools and community efforts that share our values, ambitions and love of the Web.</p>


<h3>What We Fund</h3>

<p>We make grants to people and organizations we know, who are either working with us or in a closely related field. Our work revolves around four areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Learning &amp; Webmaking:</strong> Tools, curricula and communities that teach kids, journalists, filmmakers — everyone — how to help make the Web.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Source Technology:</strong> Research, software and standards that extend the capacity, celebrate the values and protect the health of the Open Web.</li>
	<li><strong>User Sovereignty:</strong> Projects, campaigns and organizations that fight to keep the Web open and prioritize the interests of individual users.</li>
	<li><strong>Free Culture &amp; Community:</strong> Support to the broad community of individuals, organizations and projects that aid in the creation of technologies and projects that increase the health of the open Web ecosystem.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to Get Support</h3>

<p>If we're not intimately familiar with your project and already consider it to be tied to the Mozilla mission, we are unlikely to make a grant, however worthy the cause. If you're working on something closely related to our focus areas and want to discuss a grant, you should raise the topic with the Mozilla contributors closest to you. If you don't know anyone, then one key criteria for Mozilla grants has yet to be met: To get to know Mozilla.</p>
<p>Each grant made needs a champion inside Mozilla, someone known our community. How can you find a Mozillian to champion your project?</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get involved. Join our weekly <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmakers/Community_Calls">webmaker calls</a>, become a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/areas.html">Contributor</a>, or reach out to your local <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/community/#local-sites">Mozilla community</a> and ask how you can help. We've created multiple ways you can discover what's going on and start to participate.</li>
	<li>Contribute. Run an event, fix bugs or fork a code base. Blog about a project we support. Introduce us to a new partner. Find some way you can add value.</li>
	<li>Become indispensable. Slowly make it so that we can't live without you.</li>
	<li>Then we'll sit down for a chat. We'll explore how additional resources, including funding, can make what you're doing even more awesome.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Mozillians who wish to champion a grant, please talk to the webmaker team if it relates to leaning and webmaking. If it relates the other focus areas, then contact rowe@mozilla dot org. To be a champion, you'll need to stand up and say, "I believe in this project. I believe that this amount of money is appropriate and that the project is right for Mozilla. I will stay involved with this project over the year. I will evaluate the results of the grant at the end of the grant period."</p>
