    <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
    <p>Firefox ESR is intended for groups who deploy and maintain the desktop environment in large organizations such as universities and other schools, county or city governments and businesses.</p>

    <h4>Who is it not for?</h4>
    <p>Individual users who always want the latest features, performance enhancements and technologies in their browser without waiting for them to become available in ESR several development cycles later.</p>

    <div id="steps">
      <h4>Step 1.</h4>
      <p>Before proceeding, we strongly encourage Firefox ESR users to sign up for the <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/enterprise">Enterprise Working Group (EWG) mailing list</a>. The EWG list is a great place to discuss deploying Firefox with other community members and will be the only way to receive regular communications regarding product updates and support.</p>
      <h4>Step 2.</h4>
      <p><a href="{{ url('firefox.organizations.faq') }}">Review our handy FAQ</a> for your organization and download Firefox ESR.</p>
