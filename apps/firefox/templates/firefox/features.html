That’s why we’re constantly optimizing Firefox to be great  for the way you use the Web — things like making new tabs open up more quickly, or having the Awesome Bar provide results even faster.

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Instant Web Site ID</h4>
        <p>Want to be extra sure about a site’s legitimacy before you make a purchase? Click on its favicon for an instant identity overview. Another click digs deeper: how many times have you visited? Are your passwords saved? Check up on suspicious sites, avoid Web forgeries and make sure a site is what it claims to be. <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/Site+Identity+Button">Learn more.</a></p>

      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Content Security Policy</h4>
        <p>The Content Security Policy in Firefox is designed to shut down cross-site scripting attacks by providing a mechanism for sites to explicitly tell the browser which content is legitimate. The browser can then disregard any content that has not been blessed by the site, keeping you protected in the process.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Customized Security Settings</h4>
        <p>Control the level of scrutiny you’d like Firefox to give a site. You can even enter exceptions—sites that don’t need the third degree. Customize settings for passwords, cookies, loading images, and installing add-ons for a fully empowered Web experience. <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/Options+window+-+Security+panel">Learn more.</a></p>

        <p>Enforce parental control settings you’ve entered on Windows 7 to stop unwanted downloads and more.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Secure Updates</h4>
        <p>Firefox looks for a secure connection before installing or updating add-ons, third-party software, and <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/">Personas</a>.</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="column2">
      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Private Browsing</h4>
        <p>Sometimes it’s nice to go undercover: turn this feature on and protect your browsing history. You can slip in and out of private browsing mode quickly, so it’s easy to go back to what you were doing before as if nothing ever happened. This feature is great if you’re doing your online banking on a shared computer or checking email from an Internet café. <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/Private+Browsing">Learn more.</a></p>
        {{ platform_img('img/firefox/features/screen-private.png', alt='Private Browsing screenshot') }}
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Anti-Virus Integration</h4>
        <p>Firefox integrates elegantly with your Windows anti-virus software. When you download a file, your computer’s anti-virus program automatically checks it to protect you against viruses and other malware, which could otherwise attack your computer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Anti-Phishing</h4>
        <p>Shop and do business safely on the Internet. Firefox gets a fresh update of forgery sites a whopping 48 times a day, so if you try to visit a fraudulent site that’s pretending to be someone you trust (like your bank), a warning message will stop you before any harm is done.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Clear Recent History</h4>
        <p>Clear all your private data or just your activity over the past few hours with a few quick clicks. You have full control over what to delete, and then your info is gone for good—on your own computer or the one at your local library. It’s that easy. <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/Clear+Recent+History">Learn how it works.</a></p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Anti-Malware</h4>
        <p>Firefox protects you from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware delivered over the Web. If you accidentally access an attack site, it will warn you away from the site and tell you why it isn’t safe to use.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="column3">
      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
        <p>Many sites track your online behavior and sell that data to advertisers. If that makes you uncomfortable, Firefox lets you tell sites you want to opt out of behavioral tracking and keep your browsing habits private. <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-do-i-stop-websites-tracking-me">Learn how to opt-out of tracking.</a></p>

        <h4>Securing Website Connections</h4>
        <p>Firefox keeps attackers from intercepting your sensitive data by automatically establishing secure connections to websites that offer secure https servers.</p>
        {{ platform_img('img/firefox/features/screen-updates.png', alt='Automated Updates Bookmarking screenshot') }}
      </div>

      <div class="feature">

        <p>Plugins are small bits of third-party software built by companies like Adobe Systems or Apple to power videos, animation and games. They can be major security risks when they get out of date, so we’ve built an easy tool to help you stay current. <a href="{{ php_url('/plugincheck/') }}">Check your plugins.</a></p>

Browse ratings, recommendations, descriptions and pictures of the add-ons in action to help you make your selection.

With a single click, you can dress your browser up in simple designs, colorful patterns, and content from partners like Harry Potter and Bob Marley.</p>

        <p>Everyone likes to browse their own way, so we’ve made it easy to adjust the Firefox interface to be exactly the way you like it: re-arrange, organize, add or remove buttons or fields to change your browsing experience however you want.

        <h4>Beyond Add-ons</h4>
        <p>Add-ons are the cornerstone of customization, but adapting Firefox to suit your style doesn’t stop there. You can add new search engines, change toolbar preferences, display different sizes, shapes and styles for your browser’s navigation buttons and more. With additional preferences, you can specify a Web mail client (such as Gmail) to open up when you click on an address from a Web page or set up a news reader application for the blogs you encounter.</p>

    <div class="column1">
      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Newest Web Technologies</h4>
        <p>Site authors and developers will love Firefox’s new and enhanced functionalities. If creating advanced content and applications gets you excited, Firefox is the best browser choice. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Learn more.</a></p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>SPDY</h4>
        <p><a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/spdy-brings-responsive-and-scalable-transport-to-firefox-11/">SPDY</a> is a protocol designed as a follow-up to HTTP that reduces the amount of time it takes for websites to load. You’ll especially notice faster page load speeds on sites that support SPDY networking. SPDY also encrypts all communication with SSL, which helps make browsing with Firefox even more secure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>WebSockets</h4>
        <p>WebSockets open the door to instantaneous two-way communications between Firefox and Web servers. This makes it easier for developers to build real-time messaging applications and HTML5 games on the Web that are more responsive and interactive than ever before.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Upgrading Forms</h4>
        <p>Make annoying form implementation development a thing of the past. Firefox-integrated form features like list attributes and HTML validation provide the tools you need.</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="column2">
      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Parser</h4>
        <p>Firefox includes an HTML5-ready parser. This parser brings with it some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/svg_in_html_introduction">new capabilities, most notably inline SVG</a>, but also improves performance by running the parsing algorithm on its own processor. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>IndexedDB</h4>
        <p>Firefox includes an early version of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/IndexedDB">IndexedDB</a> to give developers a first look at experimenting with local storage in the browser.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Next-Generation Graphics</h4>
        <p>You have to see it to believe it. Thanks to our upgraded graphics engine, the rendering of text and graphics, including SVG and Canvas, is faster and sharper than ever before. Firefox automatically color-corrects images (like your digital photos) to make sure the colors are exactly as their data intended.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Scratchpad</h4>
        <p>One of our new, built-in developer tools, Scratchpad lets you build and test snippets of JavaScript code right in the browser, saving you time and precious keystrokes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>WebM and HD Video</h4>
        <p>As pioneers of HTML5 video standards, Firefox also supports the WebM format so you can watch open HD-quality video.</p>

        <h4>Fabulous Fonts</h4>
        <p>Firefox supports open font formats like WOFF, TrueType and OpenType, meaning site designers are no longer limited to a select handful of web-ready fonts as they create their sites. Because Firefox makes sure to display and render type properly even if you don’t have the font installed on your computer, you can view a wide variety of fonts while you browse.</p>

        <h4>The Language of Firefox</h4>
        <p>Firefox speaks your language like no other browser on earth. Because the Web is a public resource shared by everyone, we’ve made our browser available in as  many languages as possible. We have over 85 different translations, from French and Chinese to Finnish and Czech. <a href="{{ php_url('/firefox/all.html') }}">Find your language.</a></p>

      </div>

      <div class="feature">
        <h4>Universal Customization</h4>
        <p>Go beyond translation and experience the web in a way that makes sense to you. Local developers who know what’s best for their community have customized your Firefox browsing experience with local dictionaries, search providers, live bookmarks and Web feeds. Depending on where you live, you’ll see things like BBC headlines tailored to your region or experience features that work with Baidu, the Chinese search engine.</p>
