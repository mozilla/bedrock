<p>Mozilla is a global, nonprofit organization dedicated to making the Web
better. We emphasize principle over profit, and believe that the Web is a
shared public resource to be cared for, not a commodity to be sold. We answer
to no one but you and believe it is crucial to put you in control of your
online experience. We are aiming to give you better insight and control into
the ways your personal information is collected, used, stored and shared
online.</p>

<p>Mozilla Firefox offers a Do Not Track feature that lets you express a
preference not to be tracked by websites. When the feature is enabled, Firefox
will tell advertising networks and other websites and applications that you
want to opt-out of tracking for purposes like behavioral advertising.</p>

<div class="expander expander-even expander-first">
  <h4 class="expander-header">What is Do Not Track?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>Do Not Track is a step toward putting you in control of the way your
      information is collected and used online. Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox that
      allows you to let a website know you would like to opt-out of third-party tracking for
      purposes including behavioral advertising. It does this by transmitting a Do Not Track
      HTTP header every time your data is requested from the Web.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="expander expander-odd">
  <h4 class="expander-header">Is Do Not Track available on Firefox for Android?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>Yes. Firefox for Android is the first mobile Web browser to offer
      the Do Not Track privacy feature, and behaves the same way it does on the
      desktop. To turn Do Not Track on in Firefox for Android, simply swipe left and
      tap on Browser Tools. From the Preferences pane, tap on the box next to &quot;Tell
      sites not to track me&quot; to turn this option on or off.  </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="expander expander-even">
  <h4 class="expander-header">Does Do Not Track block ads?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>No, you will still see ads with Do Not Track enabled. However, Do Not Track
      may change the type of ads you see. For example, behavioral ads are targeted to your
      interests based on the websites you visit and the search terms you use. If you request
      that websites Do Not Track you, and the sites respect your privacy preferences, you
      will see more generic ads in place of behavioral ads.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="expander expander-odd">
  <h4 class="expander-header">How does Do Not Track work with other privacy tools?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>Do Not Track is one of many privacy solutions. Do Not Track does not replace your
      anti-virus software, will not encrypt data, and is not a security mechanism. There are
      several other <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/security">privacy and
      security</a> features within Firefox.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="expander expander-even">
  <h4 class="expander-header">Will Do Not Track affect the rest of my Web experience?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>Do Not Track may interfere with some personalized services you enjoy. For example, a Do Not Track request might mean you would have to type in your zip code each time you want to view a weather report, rather than seeing the weather automatically displayed. Personalization on websites can save you time and repetitive typing, but it requires data.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="expander expander-odd">
  <h4 class="expander-header">How do I enable Do Not Track in Firefox?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>This feature is not enabled by default. You can find the Do Not Track
      request on the Privacy pane. <span id="platform-note">On Windows,
      go to Tools &gt; Options... &gt; Privacy.</span></p>
      <noscript>
      <p>On Mac OS X, go to Firefox &gt; Preferences… &gt; Privacy. On Linux, go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy.</p>
      </noscript>
      Click to check the box next to &quot;Tell websites I do not want to
      be tracked&quot;. For more information, see the help file on

<div class="expander expander-even">
  <h4 class="expander-header">Will companies honor my Do Not Track preference?</h4>
  <div class="expander-content">
    <p>Companies are starting to support Do Not Track, but you may not notice any changes initially. We are actively working with companies that have started to implement Do Not Track, with others who have committed to doing so soon.</p>
