<h2>Emscripten</h2>

<p>Emscripten is an open source optimizing compiler for LLVM applications that
generates pure JavaScript to run directly on the web. Emscripten makes it
possible to take C and C++ programs and convert them automatically to open web
applications with no plugins or extensions.</p>

<p>Emscripten demonstrates that the web is capable of supporting the
responsive, real-time user experiences of interactive desktop software,
including games, simulations, and even live video decoding. Many applications
run within an order of magnitude of their native binary performance. At the
same time, Emscripten serves to diagnose and address performance bottlenecks in
the web platform, to keep pushing the boundaries of tomorrow’s web.</p>

<h2>Rust</h2>

<p>Rust is a new programming language for developing reliable and efficient
systems. Rust is designed to support concurrency and parallelism, for building
platforms that take full advantage of modern hardware. Its static type system
is safe and expressive, and provides strong guarantees about isolation,
concurrency execution, and memory safety.</p>

<p>Rust combines powerful and flexible modern programming constructs with a
clear performance model to make program efficiency predictable and manageable.
One important way it achieves this is by allowing fine-grained control over
memory allocation through contiguous records and stack allocation. This control
is balanced with the absolute requirement of safety: Rust’s type system and
runtime guarantee the absence of buffer overflow, stack overflow, or access to
uninitialized or deallocated memory.</p>

<h2>Servo</h2>

<p>Servo is an experimental project to build a web browser engine designed for
a new generation of hardware: mobile devices, multi-core processors, and
high-performance GPU’s. With Servo we are rethinking the browser at every level
of the technology stack--from input parsing to page layout and graphics
rendering--to optimize for power efficiency and maximum parallelism.</p>

<p>Servo builds on top of Rust to provide a secure and reliable foundation.
Memory safety at the core of the platform ensures a high degree of assurance in
the browser’s trusted computing base. Rust’s lightweight task mechanism also
promises to allow fine-grained isolation between browser components such as
tabs and extensions without the need for expensive runtime protection schemes
like operating system process isolation.</p>

<h2>Shumway</h2>

<p>Following on the success of <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdfjs/">pdf.js</a>, a
high-fidelity PDF renderer written in pure HTML and JavaScript, the Shumway
project aims to implement an emulator for the Flash™ multimedia platform.
Shumway combines rendering techniques pioneered by the open source <a
href="https://github.com/tobeytailor/gordon">Gordon</a> emulator with a
just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Actionscript Virtual Machine that generates
optimized JavaScript.</p>

<p>Shumway’s primary goals are to demonstrate the power and expressiveness of
the HTML5 platform, as well as to discover and remedy gaps in the web
platform.</p>
