<h1>Shumway</h1>

<p>Following on the success of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdfjs/">pdf.js</a>, a high-fidelity PDF renderer written in pure HTML and JavaScript, the Shumway project aims to implement an emulator for the Flash™ multimedia platform. Shumway combines rendering techniques pioneered by the open source <a href="https://github.com/tobeytailor/gordon">Gordon</a> emulator with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Actionscript Virtual Machine that generates optimized JavaScript.</p>
<p>Shumway’s primary goals are to demonstrate the power and expressiveness of the HTML5 platform, as well as to discover and remedy gaps in the web platform.</p>
