    <dt>quotation marks</dt>
    <dd>punctuation generally goes inside quotation marks, including exclamation and question marks, unless the exclamation or question is part of the entire sentence, not just the portion contained in the quotation marks</dd>
    <dt>slashes</dt>
    <dd>if it’s in a URL, it’s a forward slash, people, not a backslash</dd>
