  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This page contains the visual identity for promoting Firefox OS. 
  Because certain assets are subject to partnership and licensing 
  agreements, we created these materials specifically and specially 
  for community and developer use. They’re intended to represent the 
  creation phase of Firefox OS and how all Mozillians play a part in 
  bringing it to life.</p>
