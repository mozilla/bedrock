<section id="our-name">
  <h2>Our name</h2>
  <p>Whether you’re talking about the project as a whole or one of our products or innovations, you should only ever use “Mozilla” to refer to the organization. In general, the name doesn’t have to appear directly in front our product names (i.e. Mozilla Firefox), but should be prominent somewhere in the design or text you’re creating (preferably on first mention or using something like Tabzilla). If you are going to use a construction like “Mozilla Firefox,” only use it to refer to official, Mozilla-created products.</p>

<section id="dino">
  <h2>A note on the dino</h2>
  <p>The classic Mozilla dino head logo served as a symbol of the organization since our earliest days, but has now been retired from active duty. While the brand has evolved, the dino had not been updated in quite some time and is no longer the best representation of who we are today. He spends his days traveling, reading and still looking out for the interests of users everywhere (some habits die hard). We wish him well in his future endeavors. Please use the Mozilla wordmark on all properties and materials instead.</p>
