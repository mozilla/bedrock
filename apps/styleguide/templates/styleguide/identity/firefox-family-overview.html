  <p>Firefox is more than a browser (though it certainly is that). It’s the flagship brand that all our consumer products fall under. Any product bearing the Firefox name lets people know that it features the latest open, innovative technologies and that it’s made with a mission to keep the power of the Web in people’s hands and to build a brighter Internet future for all. The following pages go through each brand and its various elements in detail.</p>
