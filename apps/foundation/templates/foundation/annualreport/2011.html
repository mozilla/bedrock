              Firefox OS is the first truly open mobile platform. Developers
              are already embracing HTML5, but so far HTML5 applications on

              In June 2012 we released an update to <a href="{{ mobile_url }}" rel="external">Firefox for Android</a>
              that we believe is the best browser for Android available. We completely
              rebuilt and redesigned the product in native UI, resulting in a
              snappy and dynamic upgrade to mobile browsing that is significantly
              faster than the Android stock browser. This made Firefox significantly
              faster on Android and delivered a much better browsing experience to
              users than the one offered by the device’s stock browser. We also
              added Do Not Track to Firefox for Android to let users express their
              intent for privacy, even on mobile and are the first mobile browser
              to offer Do Not Track. Firefox for Android is a critical part of
              supporting the open Web. This is a great start, but it is only a start.
              We want these opportunities to exist at all layers of our Web experience.

              The Social API will support multiple providers and has endless potential

              Mozilla was instrumental in the movement to motivate the Web
              community to act against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect
              IP act. These laws, had they gone into effect, would have given the
              US government and private businesses incredible censorship powers
              that would have global ramifications, weaken the Internet's security
              and discourage innovation and investment worldwide.

              Mozilla was one of many organizations that blacked out its websites
              in opposition to the SOPA/PIPA bills in congress. For the first time,
              the Web community of more than 15 million people came together to
              speak against a policy that affected the Web as a whole. This historic
              protest represented a significant turning point for the Web as a way
              to engage the electorate and mobilize citizens for change.

              Early in 2012, Mozilla warned against the ratification of the
              Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (<abbr>ACTA</abbr>) by the
              European Parliament. <a href="{{ acta_url }}" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">In a blog post</a>,
              Mitchell Baker urged the policymakers that opaque processes were a
              “bad way to develop Internet policy” — in particular, that the global
              trade agreement was negotiated in private without open involvement
              of all the stakeholders. After massive street protests of Net-savvy
              citizens across Europe, the European Parliament rejected ACTA on
              July 4th in an unequivocal vote.

        Along with this annual report, we released our audited financial
        statements for 2011. Mozilla remains well positioned, both financially
        and organizationally, to advance our mission of building openness,
        freedom and participation into the Internet.

        Mozilla remains financially healthy; we continue to hire more
        people globally, we’ve opened new Mozilla Spaces around the world,
        have launched significant new initiatives such as Firefox OS and
        are able to support those with viable resources.

        The majority of our revenue comes from the search functionality
        in the Firefox browser. Google is the largest source of revenue and
        in December 2011, we announced that we negotiated a significant and
        mutually beneficial revenue agreement with Google. This new agreement
        extends our long term search relationship with Google for at least
        three additional years.

        Mozilla has a number of other relationships in the Web community,
