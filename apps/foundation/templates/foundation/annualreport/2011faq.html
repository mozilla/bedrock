          Firefox OS is Mozilla’s mobile operating system, based entirely
          on HTML5. Today, 50 percent of 2.3 Billion people who go online
          do so primarily through a mobile device, and that number is
          expected to grow. With Firefox OS, Mozilla has set out to develop
          and a completely open and standards-based Web as a platform for
          innovation. We've built the technologies and
          <abbr title="Application Program Interfaces">APIs</abbr> to make
          the Web a rich and viable option and we are committed to driving
          forward the adoption of HTML5 as a platform for the mobile industry.

          With the Mozilla Webmaker program, we are aiming to move millions
          of people from Web users to active Web creators who will build the
          next great Web experiences. The goal is to create a more Web
          literate planet through tools and learning programs that fuel
          creativity on the Web.

        {% trans %}
          At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we are doing to improve
          the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users
          and developers. We succeed when we build products that people love,
          and when other organizations build the traits and features we
          care about into competing products. For example, we view Google
          Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered
          to be a success for Mozilla and our mission.

          Unlike our major competitors, Mozilla achieves success by helping
          more people make choices about what software they want to use, what
          level of participation they would like to have online, and how to
          take part in building a better Internet. When we see growth in
          community contributors, software localizations, and a competitive
          browser market, for example, we know we are moving toward our goals
          and we are seeing growth in these areas.

          Mozilla’s consolidated reported revenue (Mozilla Foundation and all

          The majority of Mozilla’s revenue is generated from search and

          major search partners including Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex,
          Amazon, Ebay and others. Mozilla’s reported revenues also include
          very important individual and corporate donations and grants, which
          are growing significantly, as well as other forms of income from
          our investable assets.

          We currently have several key business partnerships and are
          actively exploring new  partnership opportunities as well as
          other potential revenue opportunities. We’ll continue to build
          great products that help people enjoy the richness of the
          Internet, and we’re confident that this allows us to identify
          appropriate sources of revenue that serve both the mission and
          our users.

          We currently have partnerships with a number of search providers
          that differ by market. In December 2011, we announced a new
          agreement with Google as the default search provider in Firefox.
          This new agreement extends our long-term search relationship with
          Google for at least three additional years. The specific terms of
          this commercial agreement are subject to traditional confidentiality
          requirements, and we’re not at liberty to disclose them.

          Bing is included as a search provider in the US versions of Firefox.

          Google is the default search provider on the Russian builds of
          Firefox. Yandex will remain in the pre-installed list of search
          plug-ins. The change is part of the global search renewal that
          Mozilla entered into with Google, which makes Google the search
          default.

          Mozilla believes that the Web is the best platform for innovation,

          With Firefox OS, Mozilla is creating an operating system based
          entirely on open Web standards. HTML5 is an increasingly important
          technology, which more and more developers are embracing. There
          is also an HTML5 ecosystem of developers who are already creating
          applications for desktop web browsers, while many AppStore and
          Android applications have already been developed in HTML5.

          The Mozilla Marketplace will offer developers’ discovery, distribution
          and monetization opportunities and will also be customizable by
          partners. For example, with Telefónica, we will provide direct-to-bill
          capabilities in the device, in the event that app store owners would
          like to bill Telefónica customers directly. But app developers are
          free to use their own billing systems. You can read about this in
          the Telefónica Marketplace Payments Guide for further details of
          how payments will work.
