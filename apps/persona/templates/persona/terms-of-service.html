  <h3>Terms of Service</h3>

    These Terms of Service (“TOS”) govern your use of the Mozilla Persona service (the “Services”). By accessing the materials and APIs necessary to use the Services, and by using the Services you are agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions described below.

  <h4>Use of the Services as a Requesting Website or Email Provider</h4>

  <p>
    To use the Services a website must include in their pages a JavaScript library provided by Mozilla and use the provided API to request a verified email address. If a user has chosen to  verify an email address as part of the Services, Mozilla will send a confirmation email to the email address.  When we receive a response from that email account or a confirmation from the email provider, we will store that verification and confirm to the user  that the verification was successful.  After that, if the user is logged into the Services and visits your website and you would like to request a verification of the that the email address, we will issue a verification to you..  The verification will confirm that this user had access at verification time to the specified email address.
  </p>
  <p>You may use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (i) the TOS and (ii) the laws and regulations in your state and country and any other laws and regulations that apply to your use of the Services (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
