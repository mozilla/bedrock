        <h1>Our Principles</h1>
        <p>Six core privacy principles guide our data practices and operations at Mozilla. These principles stem from
          the Mozilla Manifesto. In short, we're a non-profit dedicated to putting the user in control and shaping the
          future of the Web for the public good. These principles remind us that our users’ interests come first and
          encourage us to build a consistent approach to privacy and security:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>No Surprises</h4>
            <p>Only use and share information about our users for their benefit and as spelled out in our notices.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Limited Data</h4>
            <p>Collect and retain the least amount of user information necessary and share data anonymously whenever possible.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Real Choices</h4>
            <p>Educate users at the point that we collect any data and give them the option to opt out whenever possible.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>User Control</h4>
            <p>Innovate, develop and advocate for privacy enhancements that put users in control of their online experiences.</p>
          <li>
            <h4>Sensible Settings </h4>
            <p>Establish default settings that balance safety and user experience appropriately for each transaction.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Trusted Third Parties</h4>
            <p>Make privacy a key factor in selecting and interacting with partners.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Your Information</h1>
        <p>We know how much you value your privacy and we design our products and features with your privacy in mind.</p>
        <p>Our privacy policies and notices explain in detail what our different products will and won't do with yourinformation. They
          tell you what is collected, when it is collected, and for what reason it is collected. We want to be transparent and open
          about our privacy practices.</p>
        <h2>For us, "personal information" means:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>information which identifies you, like your name or email address; or</li>
          <li>a combination of several pieces of information which couldn't identify you on their own, but which we believe could
            become identifiable to you when combined.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information." If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>

      <section id="choices" class="section-content">
        <h1>Your Choices</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-section-header">Email</h3>
        <p>If you signed up to receive a newsletter or other email communication from Mozilla, but no longer wish to do so, you can opt out 
          from receiving them by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the next email you receive.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-section-header">Do Not Track</h3>
        <p>Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox (and some other sweet browsers) which lets you tell websites that you'd rather that they 
          don't keep track of you. You can <a href="http://dnt.mozilla.org">read more about Do Not Track</a> and how to 
          turn it on in Firefox.</p>
        <p><a id="dnt-enabled" class="button" href="http://dnt.mozilla.org/"></a></p>
        <h3 class="sub-section-header">In Products</h3>
        <p>In the software we make we include privacy and security settings with a lot of functionality. There are also plenty of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/privacy-security/">add-ons for some of our products, like Firefox</a>, which you can use to get even more control over your online experience, interactions and information.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-section-header">When we share your Information</h3>
        <p>We may release information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When we tell you we will and you consent to the sharing.</li>
          <li>For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.</li>
          <li>When we engage vendors, we negotiate to include contract terms that require vendors: (a) to limit use of the user information that we provide them only for the provision of their services to us and (b) not to correlate that user information with other information they might have.</li>
          <li>When we are fulfilling our <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/manifesto.html">mission of being open</a>. We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but we will try to remove your personal information and disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.</li>
          <li>When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit, and we'll notify you when we’re asked to hand over your personal information unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we'll only release your information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s request to disclose your information.</li>
          <li>When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else, provided that we will do so only if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.</li>
          <li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</li>
