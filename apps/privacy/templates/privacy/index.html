        <h2>Our Principles</h2>
        <p>Six core privacy principles guide our data practices and operations at Mozilla. These principles stem from the Mozilla Manifesto. 
          In short, we're a non-profit dedicated to putting the user in control and shaping the future of the Web for the public good. These 
          principles remind us that our users’ interests come first and encourage us to build a consistent approach to privacy and security:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>No Surprises</h4>
          <p>Only use and share information about our users for their benefit and as spelled out in our notices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Real Choices</h4>
          <p>Educate users at the point that we collect any data and give them the option to opt out whenever possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Sensible Settings </h4>
          <p>Establish default settings that balance safety and user experience appropriately for each transaction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Limited Data</h4>
          <p>Collect and retain the least amount of user information necessary and share data anonymously whenever possible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>User Control</h4>
          <p>Innovate, develop and advocate for privacy enhancements that put users in control of their online experiences.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Trusted Third Parties</h4>
          <p>Make privacy a key factor in selecting and interacting with partners.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Your Information</h2>
        <p>We know how much you value your privacy, so we try to collect as little information about you as possible.</p>
        <p>Our privacy policies explain in detail exactly what our different products will and won't do with your information. If you want 
          to know exactly what gets collected when and for what reason, then be sure to check the relevant policy.</p>
        <h3>Types of Information</h3>
        <h4>Aggregate Data</h4>
        <p>Information recorded about people and collected into groups so it no longer references an individually identifiable person.</p>
        <h4>Non-Personal Information</h4>
        <p>Information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>
        <h4>Potentially Personal Information</h4>
        <p>Aggregate or non-personal information that could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify a person.</p>
        <h4>Personal Information</h4>
        <p>Information that a person provides to us that personally identifies him or her.</p>

        <h2>Overview of Information Uses</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>We collect non–personally identifying information, like your browser type, and potentially personal information, like your IP 
          address, to understand how our sites are being used and how to improve them. You can learn more about modifying your settings with 
          regards to this practice in Your Choices.</li>
        <li>We may ask for personal information, like your mailing address, when we need to ship you stuff, like a Mozilla membership card 
          or an awesome t-shirt, or to detect and prevent fraud.</li>
        <li>Sometimes, we post or share aggregate, non-personal information with our community to enhance their ability to improve Mozilla’s 
          products and services.</li>
        <li>We collect non-personally identifying information contributed to us by our users on an opt-in basis for research and 
          product-improvement purposes, like in Test Pilot.</li>
        <li>We never share personal information publicly if we promised to keep it confidential at the time of collection unless we have 
          your express permission to do so.</li>
        <li>We sometimes share information with employees, contractors, subsidiaries, contributors or other people working with or for us. 
          We always endeavor to make them promise not to disclose or use that information except for Mozilla-related or non-commercial purposes. We always try to put information in non-personally identifying forms when we can.</li>
        <li>When you give us suggestions, comments, and questions about our sites and products, we sometimes make them viewable by other 
          people, and they may get re-posted on other sites. Please don't include personal information when you submit comments and feedback, 
          or when you post questions or answers on our support site!</li>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>We use web analytics software to keep track of how many visitors we have, which links are most popular, and other information 
          about how people use Mozilla websites. We use this information to help make our sites more useful and usable. If you don't want
           your session visit information on our websites to be collected and analyzed by Mozilla (or its third-party analytics providers), 
           you can use the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/opt-out.html">opt-out mechanisms.</a></p>
        <p><em><a href="https://ondemand.webtrends.com/support/optout.asp?action=out">You may opt-out of Webtrends analytics</a> across all 
          sites including Mozilla sites.</em></p>
        <h3>Advertising</h3>
        <p>We think that we make great stuff, and we think that folks can get a lot out of using it, so we sometimes advertize on other 
          sites. If you have enabled Do Not Track in your browser, our ads on other websites will honor your request not to be tracked. For 
          those who are using a browser without DNT, like older versions of Firefox or browsers produced by other vendors, we provide an 
          opt-out cookie that you can install by <a href="http://media.mozilla.com/optout.html">visiting this page</a>.</p>
        <p>You have not opted out.<br /> <input type="submit" id="opt_out_advertising" value="Opt-out of advertising tracking now »" class="button-blue"></p>
        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>If you signed up to receive a newsletter or other email communication from Mozilla, but no longer wish to do so, you can opt out 
          from receiving them by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the next email you receive.</p>
        <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
        <p>Do Not Track is a feature in Firefox (and some other sweet browsers) which lets you tell websites that you'd rather that they 
          don't keep track of you thankyouverymuch. You can <a href="http://dnt.mozilla.org">read more about Do Not Track</a> and how to 
          turn it on in Firefox.</p>
        <p><a class="button" href="http://dnt.mozilla.org/">Do Not Track Is On</a></p>
        <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
        <p>In all the stuff we make, there are a bunch of privacy and security settings and a whole load of functionality. There are also 
          plenty of add-ons which you can use to get even more control over your online experience, interactions and information:

        <h2>Third Parties</h2>
        <p>It takes a lot of work to bring you our many websites, products and services, but Mozilla can’t take all the credit. We work with 
          a number of third party service providers who we expect will respect your privacy and security.</p>
        <p>Each of our third-party providers is under a licensing agreement with Mozilla. This agreement does three things:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>It prohibits the release of personal or potentially personal information to the public.</li>
        <li>It allows each provider to use this information only in conjunction with the service or services it’s providing.</li>
        <li>It prohibits the correlation of any user data with any information collected through that provider's other products, services or 
          Web properties.</li>
