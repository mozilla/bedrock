Hi there,

Thank you for your inquiry about getting involved with the Mozilla Student Reps program. To learn more about the program and how to start representing Mozilla at your school, click here:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Student_Reps

Before you can get started, please complete the Student Reps registration form:

http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/newsletter/studentreps

Once you submit the form, you are considered an official Student Rep and are able to start promoting Firefox and Mozilla products at your college or university. You will receive a newsletter twice monthly with important program updates and campaigns so make sure to look out for that.

We look forward to keeping in touch through the channels listed on the Student Reps program wiki.

Good luck -- and thank you for representing Mozilla at your school!
