Hello,

Thank you for your interest in Mozilla.

For more information about add-on development, we recommend taking a look at the Add-on Developer Hub. This site contains documentation, tools and information on how to get in touch with other developers.

https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/

To get started developing add-ons, check out one of the following tutorials:

Builder & SDK: The quickest and easiest way to get started
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder

XUL School: A comprehensive tutorial for more advanced developers
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL_School

You can post questions and connect with other add-ons developers in the Add-ons Forum:

https://forums.mozilla.org/addons/

If you are interested in testing add-ons, you can join the quality team:

It's also helpful to install the Add-ons Compatibility Reporter and use it to let us know when an add-on is not working properly:

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to email us.
