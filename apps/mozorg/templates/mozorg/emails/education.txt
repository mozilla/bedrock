Thank you for your interest in contributing to our efforts to build a generation of webmakers.

We know that people learn best when they're making something together. So we're inviting people everywhere to meet up, make something cool, learn how the code behind the Web works -- and have a blast while doing it.

We've got all the tools and tips you need to get started at:

https://webmaker.org

These events are quick, easy, and fun -- in as little as 30 minutes, you can have a handful of friends around your kitchen table, easily hack a webpage or make something new with our tools, and have something awesome to brag about.

If you don't want to host an event and would rather contribute your time building our tools, here are some links to issue trackers -- please dive right in!
