Thanks for offering to help us build Mozilla's websites.

If you're interested in learning more about web development and how the web works, you may be interested in our Webmaker project:

If you're ready to find a web development project to get started on, take a look at our page at:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/GetInvolved

If you are interested in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we could also use your help building our new Firefox OS.  Find out more about how to help with that:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia/Hacking

If none of that interests you, check out http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/ to see other ways you can help!

This is a lot of information, so let me know if you have any questions as you get started.

Regards,
Luke
