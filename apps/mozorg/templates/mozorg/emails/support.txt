Hi there!

Thanks so much for your interest in helping users of Mozilla
technologies!

Helping is really easy and you don't need to spend a lot of time,
in only a couple of minutes you can make a difference!

There are several ways in which you can get involved, just pick
one: http://mzl.la/104TbiU

Would you like some help getting started? Get guidance from our
more experienced volunteers through the buddy program:

Or just introduce yourself to our community: http://mzl.la/16zeM5M

If you have any questions about this, feel free to write me back.

Welcome to SUMO!
