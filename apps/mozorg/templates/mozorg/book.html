<!-- This verse announces the birth of the beast (Netscape) and warns bad coders (up to Netscape 3, when you watched the HTML source code with the internal viewer, bad tags blinked). -->

<p class="moztext">
And the beast shall come forth surrounded by a roiling <em>cloud</em> of 
<em>vengeance</em>. The house of the unbelievers shall be <em>razed</em> 
and they shall be <em>scorched</em> to the earth. Their tags shall <em>blink</em> 
until the end of <em>days.</em>

<!-- 31st March 1998: the Netscape Navigator source code was released -->
<!-- The source code is made available to the legion of thousands of coders of the open source community, that will fight against the followers of Mammon (Microsoft Internet Explorer). -->

<p class="moztext">
And the beast shall be made <em>legion</em>. 
Its numbers shall be increased a <em>thousand thousand</em> fold. 
The din of a million keyboards like unto a great <em>storm</em> 
shall cover the earth, and the followers of Mammon shall <em>tremble</em>.

<!-- 15th July 2003: AOL closed its Netscape division and the Mozilla foundation was created -->
<!-- The beast died (AOL closed its Netscape division) but immediately rose from its ashes (the creation of the Mozilla foundation and the Firebird browser, although the name was later changed to Firefox). -->

<p class="moztext">
And so at last the beast <em class="f">fell</em> and the unbelievers rejoiced.
But all was not lost, for from the ash rose a <em>great bird</em>.
The bird gazed down upon the unbelievers and cast <em class="f">fire</em>
and <em>thunder</em> upon them. For the beast had been
<em>reborn</em> with its strength <em>renewed</em>, and the
followers of <em>Mammon</em> cowered in horror.

<!-- 9th November 2004: Firefox 1.0 is officially released -->
<!-- The worldwide support of Firefox fans leads to its success, illustrating the power of community-based open source projects. -->

<p class="moztext">
Mammon slept. And the <em>beast reborn</em> spread over the earth and its numbers
grew legion. And they proclaimed the times and <em>sacrificed</em> crops unto the
fire, with the <em>cunning of foxes</em>. And they built a new world in their own
image as promised by the <em><a href="/about/manifesto.html">
sacred words</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/About:mozilla">spoke
</a></em> of the beast with their children. Mammon awoke, and lo! it was
<em>naught</em> but a follower.
