      <p>The Web lets us speak out, share, and connect around the things that matter. It creates new opportunities, holds governments to account, breaks through barriers, and makes cats famous. This isn't a coincidence. It's because the Web belongs to all of us: We all get a say in how it's built.</p>
      <p>Mozilla has made it <a href="{{ url('mozorg.mission') }}">our mission</a> to keep the power of the web in people's hands. But all this could change on December 3.</p>
      <p>Our governments are going to meet in Dubai to decide whether an old treaty, the International Telecommunication Union, can be expanded to regulate - to control - the Internet.</p>
      <p>The issue isn't whether our governments, the UN, or even the ITU should play a role in shaping the Web. The problem is that they are trying to do it behind closed doors, in secret, without us.</p>
      <p>We believe everyone should have a voice. And this site is to help you be heard in Dubai.</p>
