        The Mozilla project <a href="{{ coderush }}">was created</a>
        in 1998 with the <a href="{{ sourcerelease }}">release of
        the Netscape browser suite source code</a>
        that was intended to harness the creative power of thousands
        of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels
        of innovation in the browser market.
        Within the <a href="{{ firstyear }}">first year</a>, new
        community members from around the world
        had already contributed new functionality, enhanced
        existing features and became engaged in the management and
        planning of the project itself.

        By creating an open community, the Mozilla project had become
        <a href="{{ stevecase }}">larger than any one company</a>.
        Community members got involved and expanded the scope of the
        project's original
        <a href="{{ mission }}">mission</a>&mdash;instead of just
        working on Netscape's next browser, people started creating

        of other <a href="{{ projects }}">projects</a>.  People
        contributed to Mozilla in different ways, but everyone was
        passionate about creating free software that would enable
        people to have a choice in how
        they experienced the Internet.

        supported by individual donors and a variety of companies.
        The new Mozilla Foundation continued the role of managing the

        the role of promoting
        <a href="{{ manifesto }}">openness, innovation, and opportunity</a>
        on the Internet.  It did this by continuing to release
        software, such as Firefox and Thunderbird, and expanding to
        new areas, such as providing <a href="{{ grants }}">grants</a>
        to support accessibility improvements on the Web.

        Mozilla celebrated its

        ten years the community has shown that commercial companies

        great end user products can be produced as
        open source software.  More people than ever before are using
        the Internet and are experiencing it

        organization has been created that uses market

        The next ten years have challenges and opportunities equal
        to those of our first decade.  There's no guarantee that
        the Internet will remain open or enjoyable or safe.
        Mozilla will continue to provide an opportunity for people
        to make their voices heard and to shape their own online lives.
        Of course, we're not alone in doing this.  The Mozilla
        community, as well as other open source projects and other
        public benefit organizations, exists only because of the
        people who are engaged with making our common goals a
        reality.  If you want to join us in our mission, please
