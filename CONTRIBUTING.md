# Info for Contributors

Hi there. Thanks so much for helping us out with mozilla.org! There are a few
things you should know. Most of the things are in the
[bedrock docs](http://bedrock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html). These
docs have a lot of information about how to get your local environment setup
for development, as well as how to format your code and commit messages.
Following these guidelines will very much increase the chances of a pleasant
code-review experience.

## HUGE PROJECT STRUCTURE CHANGE

On Wednesday, May 15th we'll be merging a very large refactoring of the
codebase ([PR #755](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/pull/755)). Any
pull-requests not merged by that point will need a major rebase, and we won't
be merging anything for the day preceeding this work and until we push it live.
