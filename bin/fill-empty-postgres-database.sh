# 1. Set up the database with the full Django schema, but no data.
# Note that PROD_DETAILS_STORAGE needs to not be DB-backed for this
# initial load, to avoid a chicken-and-egg import situation

# 2. Run db update scripts to pull down the usual data sources
./bin/run-db-update.sh

# 3. Port the Contentful data (for the VPN Resource Center pages) from sqlite
# (Contentful sync is not enabled and doesn't work any more, but
# we can get the data from the sqlite db in the bedrock install)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/bedrock.db ./manage.py dumpdata contentful.contentfulentry -o /tmp/contentful_data.json

#Â ...and then load it in to postgres
