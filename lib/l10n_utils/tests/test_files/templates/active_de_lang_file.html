        Mozilla‘s vision of the Internet is a place where anyone can
        access information, a place where everyone can hack and tinker;
        one that has openness, freedom and transparency; where users have
        control over their personal data and where all minds have the
        freedom to create and to consume without walls or tight restrictions.
