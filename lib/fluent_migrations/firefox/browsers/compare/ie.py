Then, if you need to do things like check your personal email or shop online, you can just switch over to the more secure browser. The bottom line is, if Microsoft is warning people not to use Internet Explorer, don’t use it. Your online privacy and security are not worth risking because you (or your company) have a hard time breaking an old habit. We make Firefox with security and privacy features like <a %(lockwise)s>Lockwise</a>, our password manager, private browsing and lots of other add-ons that help us make the web safer for you. Also, our <a %(privacy)s>Privacy Policy</a> is straightforward: we tell you what we know about you, and why we collect that information.
