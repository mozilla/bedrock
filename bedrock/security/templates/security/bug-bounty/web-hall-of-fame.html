  <p><strong>Our Web bug bounty program has been migrated to HackerOne.</strong> Therefore, we will discontinue adding researchers on this page. Starting from May 2023, researchers will be recognized on our HackerOne pages, <a href="https://hackerone.com/mozilla_critical_services">Mozilla Critical Services</a> and <a href="https://hackerone.com/mozilla_core_services">Mozilla Core Services</a></p>
