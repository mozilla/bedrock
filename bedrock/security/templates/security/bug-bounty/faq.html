      <h2>General questions</h2>

      <dl class="faq">
        <dt class="question" id="why">Why is the Mozilla Foundation doing
          this?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Because we want to encourage more people to find and report
            security bugs in our products, so that we can make our products even
            more secure than they already are. It's as simple as that.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="eligibility">Are Mozilla developers
          eligible for the bug bounty reward?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes. Anyone is eligible to receive a reward except for employees of
            the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries and the creators and
            reviewers of the code in which the bug was found. However, as noted in
            the policy, if you found this bug as part of your job (in other words,
            while being paid to work on Mozilla) then we'd appreciate it if you
            would not apply for the bounty, in order to preserve our limited funds
            for rewarding volunteer contributors.</p>

          bounty reward if I discover a bug in Camino, Galeon, K-Meleon, Netscape
          7, Mozilla Suite, SeaMonkey, or other products based on Mozilla code?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Only if we can reproduce the problem in the most recent version
            of Firefox, Firefox for Android, and/or Thunderbird.</p>

          and distributed as part of the Mozilla project?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>No. We have decided to use our limited resources to focus on our
            end-user products, as opposed to the other software produced and used
            by the Mozilla project.</p>
        </dd>

          "most recent version" of Firefox, Firefox for Android, and/or
          Thunderbird?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>In general we mean the releases available for download on the <a
            href="{{ url('firefox.family.index') }}">mozilla.org download pages</a> at the time the
            bug was reported. However we will also consider paying rewards for
            security bugs as discussed in the questions and answers below.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="older-releases">Can I get the bug
          bounty reward if I discover a bug in an older release of Firefox,
          Firefox for Android, and/or Thunderbird?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>In general bugs found in earlier releases are eligible for a
            reward only if we can reproduce the problem using the most recent
            version.</p>

          <p>However as a special exception we will also consider paying
            rewards for bugs found in the most recent releases from designated
            stable branches (e.g., from the Mozilla 17 Extended Support Release branch while
            supported) if the bugs are not present in the most recent version but
            were never recognized and fixed as security bugs. (For example, the bug
            might be in code associated with a feature that was removed and/or
            heavily modified in the most recent version, and might have been
            "fixed" solely as a byproduct of other unrelated changes.)</p>

          reward if I discover a bug in a pre-release version of Firefox, Firefox for
          Android, or Thunderbird?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes, as long as the bug otherwise meets the published bug bounty
            program guidelines. Bugs found in Aurora and Beta releases of Firefox and
            Firefox for Android, EarlyBird and Beta releases of Thunderbird are eligible as
            long the bug is reproducible in the latest nightly mozilla-central build and has
            not been previously reported.</p>

          build, optimized build, or third-party Firefox, Firefox for Android, or
          Thunderbird distribution)?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes, if the bug can be reproduced in an official Mozilla
            Foundation release and otherwise meets the published guidelines.</p>

          <p>Yes, if the operating system is officially supported by the most
            recent version of the product for which you're reporting the bug. (For
            a list of supported operating systems and hardware configurations see
            the system requirements for <a href="{{ url('firefox.sysreq') }}">Firefox</a>,
            <a href="{{ firefox_url('android', 'sysreq') }}">

      <h2>Eligible bugs</h2>

      <dl class="faq">
        <dt class="question" id="eligible-bugs">What types of security bugs are
          eligible?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Reproducible security bugs that are determined to be rated
            <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings">sec-critical or
              sec-high</a> are eligible. In general we consider critical security bugs to be
            those that allow execution of arbitrary code on users' systems, while high
            severity security bugs allow access to users' confidential information. In the
            latter case we consider bugs to be sec-high only if they potentially expose
            high-value personal information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers, and the
            like); in the context of the bug bounty program we do not consider bugs to be
            sec-high if they potentially expose only lower-value information (e.g., browsing
            history) or information that would be useful primarily for other exploits
            (e.g., the names of files or directories on the user's system).</p>

          <p>Finally, in general we do not consider bugs that permit only denial of
            service attacks to be eligible in the sense described above.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="dos-bugs">Why won't you provide a
          reward for denial of service (DoS) bugs?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Because DoS bugs are generally less serious than other security
            bugs (e.g., they typically do not lead to corruption or destruction of
            user data, much less theft of data), and in many cases a DoS attack
            does not involve an actual bug but simply misuse of standard product
            features (e.g., putting up a web site with an excessive number of
            graphics, sending excessively long mail messages, etc.). We have
            decided to concentrate our limited resources on rewarding people who
            find what we consider to be more serious security problems.</p>
        </dd>

      <h2>Bug reporting, etc.</h2>

      <dl class="faq">
        <dt class="question" id="already-published">I've already
          published information about the bug, and didn't go through the Mozilla
          bug process; can I still get a reward?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes, as long as the bug report occurred after the official
            announcement of the bug bounty program on August 2, 2004, and otherwise
            meets the published bug bounty program guidelines (e.g., the bug has
            not been reported previously and is reproducible in the most recent
            version of the affected product).</p>

          <p>However we do encourage people to <a
            href="mailto:security@mozilla.org?subject=Security%20exploit%20submission">
            report bugs directly</a> to the Mozilla project, in order to ensure that the
            bug is made known as soon as possible to the people who can fix it.</p>

          directly to you, do I have to keep the bug confidential and not publish
          information about it in order to receive a reward?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>No. We're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy
            your silence. However if you report the bug through the standard
            Mozilla process and haven't already published information about it then
            we do ask that you follow the guidelines set forth in the official
            policy on <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.governance.policies.security.bugs') }}">handling
            Mozilla security bugs</a>. Under this policy security-sensitive bug
            reports in our Bugzilla system may be kept private for a limited period
            of time to give us a chance to fix the bug before the bug is made
            public, with an option for the bug reporter (or others) to open the bug
            to public view earlier whenever circumstances warrant it (e.g., if your
            bug report is being completely ignored).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="cooperation">I don't have the time or
          desire to work with you further in investigating and fixing the bug;
          can I still get a bug bounty reward?</dt>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes. Again, we're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to
            buy your cooperation. However we do invite you to work together with
            us, and we hope that you'll accept that offer in the spirit in which it
            was intended. In return you'll get the opportunity to work as a full
            member of the team fixing your bug and see "from the inside" exactly
            how Mozilla security bugs get resolved.</p>
