        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Mozilla client software relies on web services, and Mozilla’s community uses
          websites and services to communicate and coordinate activity.
          Our goal is to make our products and services more secure.
          Mozilla community members submitted bugs before we had an official bounty program
          to reward researchers. The bounty program is designed to incentivize bug reporting towards the websites,
          services, and types of bugs we’d like community members to focus on.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="howto">How can I find potential vulnerabilities
          and are there things I shouldn’t do in trying to find them?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>We have received many questions around how to find web application
            security issues. The most common concern is the use of automatic tools.
            We ask that people don’t use automatic tools against our web services
            as it is important to maintain our services and availability. We do
            encourage people to examine typical areas for vulnerabilities such as
            authentication and session management. Since our code is open source, you are
            encourage to run on the software on your own server instance or just look
            at the source code for potential issues.</p>
            <p>On Mozilla’s Wiki, you can find information about some of our
              <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/TestingToolchains/">security testing toolchains.</a></p>
            <p>See the list below for the domains and applications which are in scope.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="bounty-amount">Is the amount of the bounty
          different for web applications vulnerabilities?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Payments vary according to the severity of the issue, with the range
            starting at $500 (US) for moderate severity and up to $3000 (US) for
            High or Critical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="severity-ratings">Is there a list of severity
          ratings with examples?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes, here it is:
            <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Web_App_Severity_Ratings">
              Web Application Severity Ratings</a></p>
              The bounty committee’s reward is based on the security and privacy
              impact of the bug and ultimately the importance of the website or service.

          <p>The Mozilla Developer Network (developer.mozilla.org) and wiki.mozilla.org have been removed from this
            list due to site vandalism by researchers looking for security issues. They will be
            added back at a later date when a test server is deployed to avoid negative impacts
            on our primary reference site.</p>

          <p>Only Mozilla websites and services are in scope. Issue categories explicitly excluded
            from eligibility include denial of service attacks, email phishing attacks
            against employees, our offices, etc. Additionally, flaws relying on out-of-date
            browsers, plugins, or add-ons, which require extremely unlikely/unusual user
            interaction, and banner and version information are generally not eligible.</p>

        <dt class="question" id="sites-not-listed">What about sites which are not
          listed?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>If you find an issue with a site which is not “officially” part under the
            website and services bug bounty program, we would still like to know. If the bug is
            extraordinary, we might still consider the bug to be nominated for a bounty. In
            the past we have paid for interesting bugs which are outside of normal
            policy, but it’s the rare exception and not the rule. It's hard to define “extraordinary”,
            since by definition there are no common examples.
            If you are searching security issues for the joy of it or to help the Mozilla project,
            we would appreciate reports on non-eligible sites.
            If you are looking for bug bounties, focus on the sites listed as eligible, don’t hunt for
            “extraordinary” bugs on sites not listed in thie FAQ.

        <dt class="question" id="issues">What types of issues will be considered
          as part of the bounty program?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>While there are many types of web vulnerabilities, the list below directly
            affects our users and our infrastructure. These are just a few examples.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cross-site request forgery</li>
            <li>Mixed-content scripts</li>
            <li>Authentication or authorization flaws</li>
            <li>Server-side code execution bugs</li>
            <li>Cross-site scripting bugs (XSS) other than self-XSS</li>
            <li>Remote File Include (RFI)</li>
            <li>Local File Include (LFI)</li>
            <li>Injection issues and logic bugs with a demonstrated Medium to higher security impact. Example: A bug that leaks user email addresses intended to remain private qualifies. Being able to change an inconsequential piece of data associated with a user where there is no other demonstrated security issue and/or zero to low impact does not.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We generally consider HTML and text injection to be low-risk and thus not bounty-eligible.</p>
          <p>Redirect issues are generally ineligible unless they can be used as part of a more significant attack such as CRLF injection or XSS.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Web_App_Severity_Ratings">
              Web Application Severity Ratings</a> explains how Mozilla measures website and
              service security risk. Medium, High, and Critical issues reported are eligible
              for bounties when confirmed.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="dos-bugs">Why won’t you provide a reward
          for denial of service bugs?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Because DoS bugs are generally less serious than other web application
            security bugs and in many cases a DoS doesn’t need to involve a technical
            vulnerability within a web application. We have decided to concentrate our
            resources on rewarding people who find what we consider to be more
            serious security problems.</p>

            When filing, please verify that you have followed the guidance on how to

            errors and omissions, then update your documentation to be submitted.

          <p>No. We’re rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy
            your silence. However if you report the bug through the standard
            Mozilla process and haven’t already published information about it then
            we do ask that you follow the guidelines set forth in the official
            policy on
            <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.governance.policies.security.bugs') }}">handling Mozilla security bugs</a>.
            Under this policy security-sensitive bug reports in our Bugzilla system
            may be kept private for a limited period of time to give us a chance to
            fix the bug before the bug is made public, with an option for the bug reporter
            (or others) to open the bug to public view earlier whenever circumstances
            warrant it (e.g., if you feel your bug report is being completely ignored).
            However, in the interest of protecting our users, we would appreciate a
            reasonable amount of time to address the issue before the information is
            publicly disclosed.</p>

            us, and we hope that you’ll accept that offer in the spirit in which it
