        <dd>
          <p>Mozilla client software relies heavily on web services, and Mozilla’s
          community uses our websites and services to communicate and coordinate activity.
          Our goal is to make these products and services as safe and secure as possible.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="howto">How can I find potential vulnerabilities and are there things I shouldn’t do in trying to discover them?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>We have received many questions around how to discover web application
            security issues, largely revolving around use of automated attack tools
            such as ZAP and Burp.</p>
          <p>We request that people refrain from using automated tools against our production web
            services, as it is important to maintain our services' availability and minimize
            unintentional vandalism. Since our code is open source, you are encouraged to run
            it on your own server instance or examine the it directly for potential issues.</p>

      <dl class="mzp-u-list-styled">
        <dt id="eligible-bugs">Which domains and web applications will be considered to be part of the bug bounty?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Although all of our non-community websites are considered in scope for acknowledgment on our
          <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty.web-hall-of-fame') }}">hall of fame</a>, only
          a limited subset are eligible for monetary payouts. Please see our

          for additional information.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="dos-bugs">Why don’t you provide a reward for denial-of-service bugs?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Denial-of-services bugs are generally less serious than other web application
          security bugs and in many cases don't require a technical vulnerability
          within the web application.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>The sooner we can reproduce the bug, the sooner we can fix it
            and send you your bounty. Please submit all bugs using the
            <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.web.bounty">Bugzilla web bounty form</a>.
            <strong>Do not send vulnerabilities via email and please avoid using video.</strong></p>

          <p>There are three main things you can provide which will help us
            to evaluate your submission quickly and pay a bounty sooner:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><a href="#attack-scenario">What is the attack scenario?</a></li>
            <li><a href="#step-by-step-exploit">What is the step-by-step exploit process?</a></li>
            <li>What is the security impact?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Once you have <em>written</em> your step-by-step instructions,
            repeat the attack by following them exactly. This helps prevent
            errors and omissions in your submission.</p>

          <p>We prefer to receive bug reports in English. If English is not
            your native language and you are not fluent, please submit bugs
            in your native language. Please note that this may delay our
            response time.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="nondisclosure">If I report the bug directly to you, do I have to keep the bug confidential to receive a bounty?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>We’re rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy
          your silence. However, if you report the bug through the standard
          Mozilla process and haven’t already published information about it then
          we do ask that you keep the bug private for a limited period of time to
          give us a chance to fix the bug before the bug is made public.</p>

          <p>Bug reporters may open the bug to public view earlier whenever circumstances
          warrant it (e.g., if you feel your bug report is being completely ignored).
          However, in the interests of protecting our users, we would appreciate a
          reasonable amount of time to address the issue before the information is
          publicly disclosed.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="cooperation">If I don’t have the time to assist you further, can I still receive a bug bounty?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>We’re rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy your cooperation.</p>
          <p>However, we do invite you to work together with us, and we hope that you’ll
          accept that offer in the spirit in which it was intended. In return, you’ll get
          the opportunity to work as a full member of the team and see exactly how Mozilla
          security bugs are resolved.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="attack-scenario">What does a valid attack scenario look like?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Please describe how an attacker would use the bug you
          are submitting, any necessary conditions for it to work, and what the attacker
          would gain through a successful attack.</p>

          <p>Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability:</p>

          <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
            <li>What is the necessary position of the attacker?
              <ul>
                <li>Do you need to be logged in or unauthenticated?</li>
                <li>Do certain cookies need to be set?</li>
                <li>Do you need to connect from a specific system?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Are there any other assumptions that must be made about the victim?
              <ul>
                <li>Do they need to be running a specific web browser?</li>
                <li>Does the victim need to be tricked into clicking on a specific link?</li>
                <li>Does the user need to be a member of a specific group?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>How might a malicious actor use this attack?
              <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
                <li>Stealing a victim's session information</li>
                <li>Redirect users to malicious websites</li>
                <li>Read files on server outside the web root</li>
                <li>Executing remote OS commands</li>
                <li>XSSing users</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </dd>

        <dt id="step-by-step-exploit">What does a valid step-by-step exploit process look like?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Please describe the process required, step-by-step, in the proper order.
           If there are multiple parties involved, please describe them all clearly. For example:</p>

          <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
            <li>Visit <code>https://shop.firefox.com/order?name=value&amp;name2=value2</code></li>
            <li>Click the "Log in" link and login</li>
            <li>Click the "Order" button</li>
            <li>Place order for "Firefox Plush"
            <li>Continue navigation to the Shipping Address page</li>
            <li>Add the following payload <code>"&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain);// &gt;</code> into the "City" field, then click Submit</li>
            <li>The XSS payload ends up in the <code>POST</code> parameter named <code>city_order</code></li>
            <li>Visitors to the page <code>/past_orders_by_city</code> are affected by stored XSS</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Include the HTTP request(s), any necessary header values and/or
            <code>POST</code> parameters along with your bug submission.</p>

          <p>Once you have <em>written</em> your step-by-step instructions,
          repeat the attack by following them exactly. This helps prevent errors
          and omissions in your submission.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="xss-reporting">How should I report an XSS vulnerability?</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>For a reflected XSS vulnerabilities, the affected URL along with
          a working payload is usually sufficient. For stored XSS attacks, please
          describe the step-by-step exploit process, as above.</p>

          <p>Please use <code>alert(document.domain)</code> and not
          <code>alert(1)</code> in your proof-of-concept.</p>

          <p>Self-XSSes &mdash; where the attacker tricks users into copying
          and pasting malicious script content &mdash; are not eligible for
          bounties.</p>
