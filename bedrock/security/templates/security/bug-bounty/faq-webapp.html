      <p>This FAQ attempts to answer various questions about how the
        Mozilla security bounty program relates to Web Applications.
        This FAQ covers web applications and if you are reporting an issue
        unrelated to a web application security vulnerability,
        (e.g. a security issue in the Firefox browser), please see the original:
        <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty.faq') }}">Security Bug Bounty Program FAQ.</a>
        For more about the background of the bug bounty program see the
        <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty') }}">official guidelines</a>
        governing the program.</p>

        <dt class="question" id="why">Why do we include web applications
          as part of our security Bug Bounty Program?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Mozilla client software relies on web services, and Mozilla's community uses 
          websites and services to communicate and coordinate activity.
          Our goal is to make our products and services more secure.
          Mozilla community members submitted bugs before we had an official bounty program 
          to reward researchers.
          The bounty program is designed to incentivize bug reporting towards the websites, 
          services, and types of bugs we'd like community members to focus on.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="howto">How can I find potential vulnerabilities
          and are there things I shouldn’t do in trying to find them?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>We have received many questions around how to find web application
            security issues. The most common concern is the use of automatic tools.
            We ask that people don’t use automatic tools against our web services
            as it is important to maintain our services and availability. We do
            encourage people to examine typical areas for vulnerabilities such as
            authentication and session management. Since our code is opensource, you are
            encourage to run on the software on your own server instance or just look
            at the source code for potential issues.</p>
            <p>On Mozilla’s Wiki, you can find information about some of our
              <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/TestingToolchains/">security testing toolchains.</a></p>
            <p>See the list below for the domains and applications which are in scope.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="bounty-amount">Is the amount of the bounty
          different for web applications vulnerabilities?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Payments vary according to the severity of the issue, with the range
            starting at $500 (US) for moderate severity and up to $3000 (US) for
            High or Critical vulnerabilities.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="severity-ratings">Is there a list of severity
          ratings with examples?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes, here it is:
            <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Web_App_Severity_Ratings">
              Web Application Severity Ratings</a></p>
              The bounty committee's reward is based on the security and privacy 
              impact of the bug and ultimately the importance of the website or service.

          <p>The Mozilla Developer Network (developer.mozilla.org) and wiki.mozilla.org have  been removed from this
            list due to site vandalism by researchers looking for security issues. They will be
            added back at a later date when a test server is deployed to avoid negative impacts
            on our primary reference site.</p>

          <p>Only Mozilla websites and services are in scope, not email phishing attacks
            against employees, our offices, etc. Additionally, flaws relying on out-of-date
            browsers, plugins, or add-ons, which require extremely unlikely/unusual user
            interaction, and banner and version information are generally not eligible.</p>

        <dt class="question" id="sites-not-listed">What about sites which are not
          listed?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>If you find an issue with a site which is not “officially” part under the
            web application bug bounty, we would still like to know. If the bug is
            extraordinary, we might still consider the bug to be nominated for a bounty. In
            the past we have paid for interesting bugs which are outside of normal
            policy. It's hard to define 'extraordinary,' because they're extraordinary.
            If you are searching security issues for the joy of it or to help the Mozilla project,
            we would appreciate reports on non-eligible sites If you are looking for bug bounties,
            ignore "extraordinary" and focus on the sites listed as eligible.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="issues">What types of issues will be considered
          as part of the bounty program?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>While there are many types of web vulnerabilities, the list below directly
            affects our users and our infrastructure. These are just a few examples.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cross-site request forgery</li>
            <li>Mixed-content scripts</li>
            <li>Authentication or authorization flaws</li>
            <li>Server-side code execution bugs</li>
            <li>Cross-site scripting bugs (XSS) other than self-XSS</li>
            <li>Any type of injection issue</li>
            <li>Remote File Include (RFI)</li>
            <li>Local File Include (LFI)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Web_App_Severity_Ratings">
              Web Application Severity Ratings</a> explains how Mozilla measures website and
              service security risk. Medium, High, and Critical issues reported are eligible
              for bounties when confirmed.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt class="question" id="dos-bugs">Why won’t you provide a reward
          for denial of service bugs?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Because DoS bugs are generally less serious than other web application
            security bugs and in many cases a DoS doesn’t need to involve a technical
            vulnerability within a web application. We have decided to concentrate our
            resources on rewarding people who find what we consider to be more
            serious security problems.</p>

            When filing, please verify that you have followed the guidance on how to
            write your report in order to assure it is evaluated as quickly as possible.
            Repeat the attack using only your own description in order to prevent
            errors and omissions, then update your documentation to be submitted.

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>No. We're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy
            your silence. However if you report the bug through the standard
            Mozilla process and haven’t already published information about it then
            we do ask that you follow the guidelines set forth in the official
            policy on
            <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.governance.policies.security.bugs') }}">handling Mozilla security bugs</a>.
            Under this policy security-sensitive bug reports in our Bugzilla system
            may be kept private for a limited period of time to give us a chance to
            fix the bug before the bug is made public, with an option for the bug reporter
            (or others) to open the bug to public view earlier whenever circumstances
            warrant it (e.g., if you feel your bug report is being completely ignored).
            However, in the interest of protecting our users, we would appreciate a
            reasonable amount of time to address the issue before the information is
            publicly disclosed.</p>

          <p>Yes. Again, we’re rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to
            buy your cooperation. However we do invite you to work together with
            us, and we hope that you’ll accept that offer in the spirit in which it
            was intended. In return you’ll get the opportunity to work as a full

            how Mozilla security bugs get resolved.</p>
