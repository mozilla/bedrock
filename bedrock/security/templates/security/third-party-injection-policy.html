  </header>

  <p>
    The Firefox browser supports expanding its functionality with browser
    extensions and provides an extensive and well documented set of APIs
    for developers known as the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtensions API</a>.
    To date, developers have contributed tens of thousands of extensions
    available on addons.mozilla.org. Nevertheless, some third-party
    developers seek to modify the browser in ways beyond what is possible
    with a browser extension and resort to “hooking” the browser, effectively
    injecting third-party executable code modules into Firefox processes.
    Security software such as anti-virus products on Windows are the most
    prevalent examples.
  </p>

  <h2>Maintaining the User Experience - Reliable and Secure Browsing</h2>

  <p>
    Even when the desired behavior might be beneficial to users, modifying
    Firefox in this way is inherently risky. Such modifications may cause
    browser crashes, broken features, or other unexpected problems that
    degrade the user experience. When third-party software is found to
    destabilize the browser, Firefox may intervene.
  </p>

  <p>Interventions* may include, but are not limited to:</p>

  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      Detecting instability locally, notifying the user, and offering them
      the opportunity to block specific modules from being injected.
    </li>
    <li>
      Detecting instability locally, automatically blocking the unstable
      module, and providing the user an option to unblock it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Detecting aggregate instability across many users, and proactively
      blocking the module globally across all Firefox instances.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <em>
      *Current versions of Firefox do not automatically block problematic
      modules or prompt the user to do so, but we are exploring this
      functionality. Firefox does maintain a block list which is already
      used when problems are discovered from crash reporting and bug
      reports. See below for more information.
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    If a third-party feature achieved with Firefox injection works well,
    that’s great. However, if we become aware of a problem, we will
    contact the vendor if they have shared a responsive support contact
    with Mozilla. We are happy to alert external vendors about such
    issues and welcome proactive communication with vendors before
    issues arise. Please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:thirdpartysoftware@mozilla.com">thirdpartysoftware@mozilla.com</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    While we prefer to work cooperatively with other developers, our
    resources are finite and oftentimes we have to act quickly. We reserve
    the right to block third-party injections whenever we believe this is
    in the best interest of Firefox users.
  </p>

  <p>
    We intend to review this position over time and may be more restrictive
    with third-party module injection in the future.
  </p>

  <h2>In-Browser Diagnostics</h2>

  <p>
    When we encounter an interoperability issue caused by a third-party module,
    we look for a workaround or implement a mitigation patch in Firefox while
    contacting the vendor to request a fix. If those attempts are not
    successful, we globally block the module using our
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Blocklisting/DLL">blocklist</a>.
    In most cases, blocking can be limited to the problematic versions of the
    module and modules can be unblocked after a fix is implemented. Not all
    third-party interoperability issues are addressed. For example, some may
    only affect a small number of users.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Firefox, we provide an in-browser diagnostics page. The about:third-party
    page (only available on Firefox for Windows and explained
    <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/identify-problems-third-party-modules-firefox-windows">here</a>)
    in Firefox lists the injected modules together with details about the injection
    technique, loading time, and - if possible - vendor and product names.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we detect at runtime that previous Firefox crashes were caused by a
    third-party module, we may prompt the user to block or we may automatically
    block the module giving the user the option to unblock the module in the
    future, depending on the severity of the impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Recommendations</h2>

  <p>
    The rest of this document contains guidelines and best practices to
    minimize the risk of instability. We strongly recommend following these
    guidelines, both to reduce stability risk and to avoid potentially being
    misclassified as a source of instability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of the details in this document concern implementation details that
    are subject to change as we improve the performance, security and functionality
    of the browser. Note that Mozilla publishes Beta and Nightly versions of
    Firefox that can give you an early warning about upcoming changes that may
    affect your software. We recommend testing on Nightly and Beta as well as
    Release versions of Firefox.
  </p>

  <h2>Firefox Process Structure</h2>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      <p>Launcher Process (Windows-specific)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Browser Process (main process, sometimes referred to as ‘parent process’
            or ‘chrome process’ inside Firefox sources and legacy documentation)
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Content Processes (render web pages)</li>
            <li>Privileged Content Process (for Firefox Accounts and addons.mozilla.org)</li>
            <li>Privileged about: Content-like Process</li>
            <li>GPU Process</li>
            <li>RDD Process (media decoding)</li>
            <li>GMP Process (DRM decoding)</li>
            <li>Socket Process (network handling - WebRTC)</li>
            <li>WebExtensions Process</li>
            <li>WebVR Process</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Guidelines for Module Injection</h2>

  <p>
    Processes other than the Browser Process and the Socket Process should
    preferably not be injected into. Specifically, processes sitting below
    the browser process will tend to be heavily sandboxed and may have very
    limited ability to interact with the operating system, including standard
    Win32 APIs (i.e. win32k.sys may not even be accessible), or may be blocked
    from loading code with third party signatures (Arbitrary Code Guard/Code
    Injection Guard). <strong>Injecting into these may stop security
    functionality from working, or render the browser non functional</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As more functionality related to networking moves to the Socket Process,
    injecting there may be unavoidable for software that wants to monitor
    low-level network access.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Launcher Process is a process to launch the browser process and apply
    several security mitigations.  Because the launcher process terminates quickly
    after launching the browser process and is isolated from browsing-related work,
    there is no benefit to injecting a third-party module into the launcher process.
  </p>

  <p>
    These guidelines mean that if a third party vendor wants a module to be loaded
    into our process, it is necessary that their module or injector program recognizes
    the target process type and does not modify our sandboxed processes. With the
    current design, the easiest way to detect the process type is to check the last
    token in the command line string. If this is  “-contentproc”, then you are dealing
    with a child process (of any type, not necessarily content!) and typically do not
    want to inject. If the type of child process is needed, this corresponds to the
    last token (With “socket” being the Socket Process). Such implementation details
    are subject to change.
  </p>

  <p>
    On Windows, there are many known techniques to inject a module into a remote process.
    In general, a technique implemented as a part of Windows OS is safer, such as
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winmsg/hooks">Window message hook</a>
    or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/win7appqual/appinit-dlls-in-windows-7-and-windows-server-2008-r2">AppInit_DLLs</a>.
    On the other hand, a technique that modifies a code segment of a mapped image, such as
    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/detours">Microsoft Detours</a>, is strongly NOT
    recommended because if <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1696571">more than one application applies a hook on the same function</a>,
    behavior is undefined and the result is almost certainly breakage.
