      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program is designed to encourage
        security research in Mozilla software and to reward those who help us create
        the safest Internet clients in existence.</p>

      <p>Many thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linspire">Linspire</a>
        and <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Mark Shuttleworth</a>, who
        provided start-up funding for this endeavor.</p>

      <h2>General Bounty Guidelines</h2>

      <p>Mozilla will pay a bounty for certain client and service security bugs,
        as detailed below. All security bugs must follow the following general
        criteria to be eligible:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Security bug must be original and previously unreported.</li>
        <li>Security bug must be a remote exploit.</li>
        <li>Submitter must not be the author of the buggy code nor otherwise involved
          in its
          contribution to the Mozilla project (such as by providing check-in
          reviews).
        </li>
        <li>Employees of the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiaries are
          ineligible.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you found the security bug as part of your job (in other words, while
        being
        paid to work on Mozilla code) then we would appreciate your not applying
        for the bounty. Our funds are limited and we would like this program to
        focus on people who are not otherwise paid to work on the Mozilla project.</p>
      <p>Mozilla reserves the right to not give a bounty payment if we believe
        the actions of the reporter have endangered the security of Mozilla's end
        users.</p>
      <p>If two or more people report the bug together the
        reward will be divided among them. </p>

      <h2>Client Reward Guidelines</h2>

      <p>The bounty for valid critical client security bugs will be $3000 (US) cash
        reward and a Mozilla T-shirt. The bounty will be awarded for
        <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings">sec-critical and
          sec-high</a> severity security bugs that meet the following criteria:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Security bug is present in the most recent main development (i.e.,
          Aurora, Beta or EarlyBird, and nightly mozilla-central releases) or released
          versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, Firefox for Android, or in Mozilla services
          which could compromise users of those products, as released by Mozilla
          Corporation.
        </li>
        <li>Security bugs in or caused by additional 3rd-party software (e.g.
          plugins, extensions) are excluded from the Bug Bounty program.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>More information about this program can be found in the
        <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty-faq') }}">Client Security
          Bug Bounty Program FAQ.</a>

      <h2>Web Application and Services Reward Guidelines</h2>

      <p>The bounty for valid web applications or services related security bugs,
        we are giving a range starting at $500 (US) for high severity and, in some
        cases,
        may pay up to $3000 (US) for extraordinary or critical vulnerabilities.
        We will also include a Mozilla T-shirt. The bounty will be awarded for
        <a
          href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAppSec/Web_App_Severity_Ratings#
      Web_Application_Severity_Ratings_Table">
          sec-critical and sec-high</a> security bugs that meet the following
        criteria:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Security bug is present in the web properties outlined in the
          <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty-faq-webapp') }}">Web Application Security Bounty
            FAQ.</a></li>
        <li>Security bug is on the list of sites which part of the bounty.

      <h2>Process</h2>

      <p>Please <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi">file a bug</a> describing the
        security bug; be sure to check the box near the bottom of the entry
        form that marks this bug report as confidential. We encourage you
        to attach a "proof of concept" testcase or link to the bug report that
        demonstrates the vulnerability. While not required, such a testcase will
        help us judge submissions more quickly and accurately.</p>

      <p>Notify the
        <a
          href="mailto:security@mozilla.org?subject=Security%20Bug%20Bounty:&lt;DESCRIPTION&gt;">
          Mozilla Security Group</a> by email and include the number of the bug you filed
        and a brief summary. If you cannot file a bug include the full details
        in the email and attach any proof of concept testcases or links.
        Mozilla Foundation staff and the Mozilla Security Group will consider
        your submission for the Security Bug Bounty and will contact you.</p>

      <p>We ask that you be available to provide further information on the bug
        as needed, and invite you to work together with Mozilla engineers in
        reproducing, diagnosing, and fixing the bug. As part of this process we
        will provide you full access to participate in our internal discussions
        about the bug; for more information read our <a
          href="{{ url('mozorg.about.governance.policies.security.bugs') }}">policy</a>
        for handling security bugs.</p>
