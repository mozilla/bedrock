      <p>This FAQ attempts to answer various questions about how the
        Mozilla security bounty program relates to Web Applications.
        This FAQ covers web applications and if you are reporting an issue
        unrelated to a web application security vulnerability,
        (e.g. a security issue in the Firefox browser), please see the original:
        <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty-faq') }}">Security Bug Bounty Program FAQ.</a>
        For more about the background of the bug bounty program see the
        <a href="{{ url('security.bug-bounty') }}">official guidelines</a>
        governing the program.</p>

        <dt class="question" id="why">Why do we include web applications
          as part of our security Bug Bounty Program?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Many people are not aware that we have paid the bounty in the past on
            web application security vulnerabilities which impact client security.
            We are, however, expanding the bounty beyond web vulnerabilities which
            just affect the client. We also feel we should have a more formal
            structure around our web properties when it comes to paying a bounty
            because our goal is to make our products and services more secure.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt class="question" id="howto">How can I find potential vulnerabilities
          and are there things I shouldn't do in trying to find them?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>We have received many questions around how to find web application
            security issues. The most common concern is the use of automatic tools.
            We ask that people don't use automatic tools against our web services
            as it is important to maintain our services and availability. We do
            encourage people to examine typical areas for vulnerabilities such as
            authentication and session management. Since our code is opensource, you are
            encourage to run on the software on your own server instance or just look
            at the source code for potential issues.
            (See the list below for the domains and applications which are in scope.)</p>
        </dd>
        <dt class="question" id="bounty-amount">Is the amount of the bounty
          different for web applications vulnerabilities?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>In the past we have not formally paid the bug bounty on web vulnerabilities
            but we have paid the bounty for critical and extraordinary web application
            vulnerabilities.
            We are now going to include high severity web applications vulnerabilities.
            So we are giving a range starting at $500 (US) for high severity and, in some
            cases,
            may pay up to $3000 (US) for extraordinary or critical vulnerabilities.

          <p>Below is the list of domains under scope for Mozilla's web application
            security
            bug bounty. While this list doesn't include all the Mozilla web properties,
            we do plan on adding to this list as we introduce our web security process to
            other sites not included in this list.</p>

          <p>The Mozilla Developer Network (developer.mozilla.org) has been removed from this
            list due to site vandalism by researchers looking for security issues. It will be
            added back at a later date when a test server is deployed to avoid negative impacts
            on our primary reference site.</p>

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>If you find an issue with a site which is not "officially" part under the
            web application bug bounty, we would still like to know. If the bug is
            extraordinary, we might still consider the bug to be nominated for a bounty. In
            the past we have paid for interesting bugs which are outside of normal
            policy.</p>

          <p>While there are many types of web vulnerabilities, the list below directly
            affects our users and our infrastructure. These are just a few examples.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
            <li>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</li>

            for what will be part of the bug bounty. </p>

        <dt class="question" id="dos-bugs">Why won't you provide a reward
          for denial of service bugs?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Because DoS bugs are generally less serious than other web application
            security bugs and in many cases a DoS doesn't need to involve a technical
            vulnerability within a web application. We have decided to concentrate our
            limited resources on rewarding people who find what we consider to be more
            serious security problems.</p>

            file a bug</a> describing the security bug. The security check-box

        <dd class="answer">
          <p>No. We're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to buy
            your silence. However if you report the bug through the standard
            Mozilla process and haven't already published information about it then
            we do ask that you follow the guidelines set forth in the official
            policy on <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.governance.policies.security.bugs') }}">handling
              Mozilla security bugs</a>. Under this policy security-sensitive bug
            reports in our Bugzilla system may be kept private for a limited period
            of time to give us a chance to fix the bug before the bug is made
            public, with an option for the bug reporter (or others) to open the bug
            to public view earlier whenever circumstances warrant it (e.g., if you feel your
            bug report is being completely ignored).However, in the interest of
            protecting our users, we would appreciate a reasonable amount of
            time to address the issue before the information is publicly disclosed.</p>

          can I still get a bug bounty reward?</dt>
        <dd class="answer">
          <p>Yes. Again, we're rewarding you for finding a bug, not trying to
            buy your cooperation. However we do invite you to work together with
            us, and we hope that you'll accept that offer in the spirit in which it
            was intended. In return you'll get the opportunity to work as a full
            member of the team fixing your bug and see "from the inside" exactly
            how Mozilla security bugs get resolved.</p>
