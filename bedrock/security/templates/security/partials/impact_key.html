<h3>Impact key</h3>
<ul>
  <li class="level-item"><span class="level critical">Critical</span>
    Vulnerability can be used to run attacker code and install
    software, requiring no user interaction beyond normal browsing.
  </li>
  <li class="level-item"><span class="level high">High</span>
    Vulnerability can be used to gather sensitive data
    from sites in other windows or inject data or code into
    those sites, requiring no more than normal browsing actions.
  </li>
  <li class="level-item"><span class="level moderate">Moderate</span>
    Vulnerabilities that would otherwise be High or Critical
    except they only work in uncommon non-default configurations or
    require the user to perform complicated and/or unlikely steps.
  </li>
  <li class="level-item"><span class="level low">Low</span>
    Minor security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service
    attacks, minor data leaks, or spoofs. (Undetectable spoofs of
    SSL indicia would have "High" impact because those are generally
    used to steal sensitive data intended for other sites.)
