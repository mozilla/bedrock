    Why? We don't want a resource center with only one article available in it;
    better to wait a few days till translations for the rest of the content
    lands in Bedrock.

    Note that this is not about working how much of a _single_ Entry has been
    localised - it's focused on the number of localised Entries in each
    non-default locale compared to the number of entries in the default locale.
