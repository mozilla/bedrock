    Define a bedrock page.

    The URL name is the template name, with the extension stripped and the
    slashes changed to dots. So if tmpl="path/to/template.html", then the
    page's URL name will be "path.to.template". Set the `url_name` parameter
    to override this name.

    @param name: The URL path. It is passed to `django.urls.path`.
    @param tmpl: The template name.  Also used to come up with the URL name.
    @param decorators: A decorator or an iterable of decorators that should
        be applied to the view.
    @param url_name: The value to use as the URL name, default is to coerce
        the template path into a name as described above.
    @param active_locales: A list of locale codes that should be active for this page
        regardless of the state of the lang files. Useful for pages with locale-
        specific templates or non-English text in the template. Ignores the lang
        file activation tags.
    @param add_active_locales: A list of locale codes that should be active for this page
        in addition to those from the lang or ftl files.
    @param ftl_files: A list of FTL files that combined contain the strings for this page.
    @param kwargs: Any additional arguments are passed to l10n_utils.render
        as the context.
