            <p>“In these disruptive, crises-ridden times, our attention is often captured by the immediate political and technical challenges right in front of us. Facing the climate crisis and ensuring that there is a habitable planet for us and future generations to continue fighting these fights is not something that can be pushed to the back seat. I, and Mozilla, are committed to protecting the environment.”</p>

        <p>Mozilla recognizes the importance and urgency of taking action on climate change. Our <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.manifesto') }}">Manifesto</a> articulates our belief that an open internet is the most effective communication and collaboration resource, and that it can help to solve some of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change.</p>

        <p>The <strong>vision</strong> of Mozilla’s Sustainability Program is to support a sustainable future for all. The <strong>mission</strong> is to ensure Mozilla is a responsible and trusted environmental steward, to empower Mozillians to build sustainability into their work, and to support a healthy, sustainable internet.</p>

        <p>Our Sustainability Program has three strategic pillars in support of this vision and mission:</p>

          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>The first strategic pillar is <strong>to ensure Mozilla is a responsible and trusted environmental steward</strong>. We understand that if we are to be stewards of our planet, we must first address our own impacts. This includes credibly measuring and reporting Mozilla’s environmental impact and taking meaningful steps to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>

        <p>The second strategic pillar is to <strong>empower Mozillians to build sustainability into their work</strong>. To embed sustainability into the operations at any organization, an organizational transformation is required, and a critical component of this is ensuring that everyone is empowered to build with sustainability in mind. A key example of this is Mozilla’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/sustainability-needs-culture-change-introducing-environmental-champions/" rel="external">Environmental Champions program</a> in which Mozillians dedicate a portion of their time to supporting sustainability efforts, pushing forward sustainability initiatives and priorities at Mozilla, and setting positive examples on their respective teams.</p>

        <p>The third strategic pillar is to <strong>enable a healthy, sustainable internet</strong>. In order to truly have an impact, sustainability must extend beyond the four walls of Mozilla’s immediate operations by building momentum on climate action in our products and partnerships. One example of this includes curating environmental collections in Pocket, <a href="https://blog.getpocket.com/2020/04/marking-earth-day-during-a-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including during Earth Day in 2020</a>, to build awareness and inspire action. Another example is our partnership with the Ford Foundation and Ariadne to explore how technology-focused funders could respond to the climate crisis and allocate resources, which has grown into the larger <a href="https://www.ariadne-network.eu/green-screen-coalition-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Screen Coalition</a> and enabled new research <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/intersections-of-digital-rights-and-environmental-and-climate-justice/" rel="external">on the intersections of digital rights and environmental and climate justice</a>. Mozilla has also helped provide funding for sustainability projects. For example, as a result of our <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/10-projects-rethinking-data-stewardship-announcing-mozillas-latest-creative-media-awards/" rel="external">2022 Creative Media Awards</a>, Mozilla provided $258,300 to people and projects that re-imagine the way data is governed, including <a href="https://solarprotocol.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Protocol</a>, a network of solar-powered, open-source web servers that directs traffic based on available solar energy. The project models how internet technologies can utilize low-carbon infrastructure, and it is stewarded by volunteers living in Kenya, India, China, Australia, Canada, Dominica, Chile, and the United States. </p>

        <p>We acknowledge that we are still in the early stages of Mozilla’s sustainability journey. There is much work to be completed to reduce our operational impact while also supporting larger movements that drive the change we want to see in the world. We welcome these opportunities, will share what we learn along the way and are confident that we will learn from partners, too.</p>
