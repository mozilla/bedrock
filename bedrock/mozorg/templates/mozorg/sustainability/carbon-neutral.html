      <p>In 2021, Mozilla committed to being carbon neutral. Today, we are proud to share that Mozilla has achieved CarbonNeutralⓇ company certification since 2019 in accordance with <a href="https://www.climateimpact.com/news-insights/news/climate-impact-partners-releases-2023-carbonneutral-protocol-strengthening-guidance-around-climate-action-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CarbonNeutral Protocol</a>, the leading global framework for carbon neutrality. To achieve CarbonNeutralⓇ certification, Mozilla is working with <a href="https://www.climateimpact.com/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Impact Partners</a>, a specialist in carbon market solutions for climate action, and has assessed the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations.</p>

      </div>

      <p>As part of our approach, Mozilla has supported high quality carbon offset projects, accounting for our operational greenhouse gas emissions (i.e. all scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, and key scope 3 categories including business travel, employee commuting, waste generated in operations, and transmission and distribution losses) for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Mozilla partnered with EcoAct to invest in three projects, including <a href="https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madre de Dios REDD project, Peru</a>; <a href="https://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/where-we-work/british-columbia/featured-projects/west-kootenay/darkwoods/dw-carbon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darkwoods carbon forestry project, Canada</a>; and <a href="https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rimba Raya Reserve project, Indonesia</a>. When selecting projects, we prioritized criteria including additionality, durability, independent verification (e.g. Verified Carbon Standard certification), and co-benefits such as social impact and community resilience.</p>

      <p>While these offsets are an important tool to mitigate emissions that we are not yet able to avoid, we recognize that they alone do not provide or stimulate the sort of transformation that our societies need in order to truly be sustainable. The most impactful climate mitigation strategy is to reduce emissions internally where possible, and Mozilla will continue to prioritize approaches that reduce its impact while working with allies and partners to amplify our ambitions.
      </p>

      <p>Now that Mozilla has achieved CarbonNeutralⓇ company certification, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozillas-climate-commitments/" rel="external">a goal that we first announced in 2021</a>, we have the opportunity to review and update our climate commitments and will provide an update when we have more to share.</p>
