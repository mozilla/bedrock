        <p>Women continue to make up a little over one-third of the Mozilla Corporation’s workforce. We have made strides in achieving gender parity in leadership (director+) with women now representing 53.1% of leadership roles, a 4.7% increase since last year. We also note a 1.7%  increase in women in technical roles from 2021 to 2022.Currently, fewer than 1% of Mozilla Corporation employees select “other gender identities.” We recognize that gender identities exist on a spectrum.</p>

      <p>In 2022, the percentage of Black/African-American Mozillians in the U.S. in leadership roles increased from 9.6% to 11.3%. We measured slight growth in the Hispanic/Latinx employee population. In 2022, Hispanic/Latinx Mozillians accounted for 4.5% of the U.S. employee base and 4.8% in technical roles; in 2021, the numbers were 4.4% and 4.1%, respectively. Additionally, Hispanic/Latinx Mozillians represented 2% of hires and 1.5% of departures in 2022.</p>

      <p>In addition to increases, we also have opportunities worth monitoring. We measured a decrease in the hiring rates among Asian employees, and also saw a year-over-year decrease in leadership representation from 15.4% to 11.3%. The decreases in retention and leadership representation were mostly driven by the 16.9% attrition rate of Asian employees in 2022. </p>

          <li>Staff at the Mozilla Corporation includes only regular, full-time employees. Staff at the Mozilla Foundation includes regular, full-time employees and fixed-term employees, as some fixed-term staff are tied to grants or specific funding sources.</li>

          <li>In order to be in compliance with global laws, we do not track race and ethnicity outside of the United States at this time. All race and ethnicity data are for employees in the United States only, and categories are driven by United States government requirements for disclosure.</li>
          <li>Leadership representation excludes executive-ranked technical fellows and only includes all levels of directors, vice presidents and the executive team.</li>
          <li>Technical workers are defined as staff working on our products and within IT.</li>

          <li>In the event of comparison to historical reports: Any differences in values of historical data are due to data corrections and/or updates (e.g. if an employee made a change to their demographic information, we are using their most recent data for all past years).</li>
