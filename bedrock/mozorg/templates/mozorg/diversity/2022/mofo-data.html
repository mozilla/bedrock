        <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
          <li>All diversity data are self-reported and come from the Mozilla Corporation and Foundation’s human resources information system for regular employees as of December 31, 2022. Progress over 12 months is compared against December 31, 2021.</li>
          <li>Staff at the Mozilla Corporation includes only regular, full-time employees. Staff at the Mozilla Foundation includes regular, full-time employees and fixed-term employees, as some fixed-term staff are tied to grants or specific funding sources.</li>
          <li>Currently, fewer than 1% of Mozilla Corporation employees select “other gender identities.” We recognize that gender identities exist on a spectrum.</li>
          <li>In order to be in compliance with global laws, we do not track race and ethnicity outside of the United States at this time. All race and ethnicity data are for employees in the United States only, and categories are driven by United States government requirements for disclosure.</li>
          <li>Leadership representation excludes executive-ranked technical fellows and only includes all levels of directors, vice presidents and the executive team.</li>
          <li>Technical workers are defined as staff working on our products and within IT.</li>
          <li>Only voluntary departures are included in attrition calculations.</li>
          <li>Employees who opted to decline to provide demographic data are not included in the metrics provided.</li>
          <li>Some categories may not add up to 100% if fields were left blank or listed as “other.”</li>
          <li>In the event of comparison to historical reports: Any differences in values of historical data are due to data corrections and/or updates (e.g. if an employee made a change to their demographic information, we are using their most recent data for all past years).</li>
