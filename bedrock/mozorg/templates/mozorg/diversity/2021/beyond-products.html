        <h4>Africa Mradi</h4>
        <p>The Africa Mradi is a program that leverages Mozilla’s role as stewards of the open web to promote innovation grounded in the unique needs of users in African countries. Our approach is driven by local needs: to support local voices and entrepreneurs and to solve on-the-ground problems. In 2021, we expanded our presence on the continent and connected with African leaders and influencers in technology through participation in various events, and secured critical funds to scale our efforts.</p>

          <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">Over the next decade, speech is expected to become the primary way people interact with devices — from phones and laptops to digital assistants. Today’s voice-enabled devices, however, are inaccessible to vast swaths of the planet’s languages, accents, and speech patterns. Mozilla Common Voice launched in 2017 to bridge this gap and is now the world’s largest multi-language public domain voice data set, with over 18,000 hours of voice recordings in over 100 global languages and dialects. Common Voice enables anyone to donate their voices to a free publicly available database that startups, researchers, and developers can use to train voice-enabled apps, products, and services. In 2021, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH (German Development Cooperation), and the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) announced an investment of $3.4 million in Mozilla Common Voice. This funding will support the collection of voice data sets in Kiswahili, an East African language spoken by an estimated 100 million people in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan.</p>

Despite not being able to meet face-to-face, we were able to bring the spirit of the festival to life in virtual sessions, social hangouts in Spatial Chat, and through Slack, Twitter, and LinkedIn.</p>

Past speakers have hailed from Kenya, France, India, Bahrain, the U.S., the UK, and beyond. They are influential activists, hackers, engineers, journalists, and lawyers. The programming aims to educate and inspire the audience, so they leave with fresh ideas for advocacy campaigns, policies, and software. In 2021, we hosted 15 Dialogues & Debates panels (during and after MozFest) diving into a range of topics including what bias means and how to combat it online.

Awardees included a stark visualization of the ways voice technology excludes Black voices; an animated film about Afrofuturism, and more. Awardees hail from the U.S., the UK, and the Netherlands.

            In 2018, Mozilla participated in Round 2 funding with Precursor Ventures, which focuses on pre-seed and seed investments with under-served entrepreneurs. Due to their sound investing principles, commitment to early investments in women- and minority-led companies, their strong leadership team, and continued partnership with Mozilla, we have increased our engagement by participating in round four of funding.

            As part of the Responsible Computer Science Challenge, Mozilla and participating schools released the Teaching Responsible Computing Playbook. An inaugural cohort of 22 colleges and universities came together to create the playbook featuring lessons learned on how schools can update computing curricula to help students bring ethics and a holistic view of society to the design of technology products. The playbook is divided into 20 sections, including Working Across Disciplines, Choosing Computing Courses; Learning Outcomes and Assessments, Accreditation and Ethics, Broadening Participation and Responsible Computing, Discussing Justice and Equity, and more.

            Mozilla’s HBCU Collaborative Curriculum is a project-based course designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn modern software engineering practices that balance ethical considerations as they prepare to join the workforce. The course featured presentations on over 30 topics ranging from Accessibility and Prototyping, Ethical and Humane Software Design, the Software Development Lifecycle, Design Justice, and Insights from Mozilla’s Internet Health report. To support students' career and professional development, they had access to office hours with Mozilla Technical Recruiters and were invited to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlKpP43WR1c" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Zoom side chat</a> with Mozilla’s Chief of Core Products. After nearly 11 weeks and more than 30 hours of instruction, 14 students from Hampton University and Virginia State University demoed the projects they worked on over the course of the semester.
