      <p><strong>As an organization with employees, volunteers, and community members spanning the globe, we strive to ensure that who we are, what we build, and how we choose to engage the world around us reflect our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion — and that all feel empowered to join our movement.</strong></p>
      <p>Our annual disclosure gives us an opportunity to both reflect on our ambition to be a more diverse and inclusive organization and to hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we've made. In 2021, we leveraged the momentum from 2020 to build a more representative workforce and an inclusive culture internally and externally. We did this by uplifting voices that have been historically marginalized and by building a better internet that works for everyone. </p>
      <p>Leaning into our own culture of technical experimentation we piloted programs, captured feedback, and refined and scaled efforts, all in hopes of increasing our impact. With a spirit of curiosity and an openness to innovation, we ran over 100 experimental programs and initiatives of varying scale, complexity, and size. Our experiments included launching a 6-month program aimed at <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/careers/mozilla-inclusion-champions/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">building skills for allyship</a>, partnering with podcasts to <a href="https://getpocket.com/collections/behind-the-worlds-first-viral-video" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">amplify historic events</a>, expanding partnerships with HBCUs to explore ethical computing and apply an <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/using-education-and-intersectionality-to-fight-bias/">intersectional lens to bias in AI</a>, and increasing investment in a venture capital fund supporting women and minority-led businesses. Each effort enabled us to learn more about how best to serve the needs of our organization and our communities. These actions enabled over 65% of our organization to meaningfully engage with DEI efforts and make progress in their own learning journey. </p>

      <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
        <li>
          <strong>Increased the representation of historically excluded communities:</strong>
          <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
            <li>At the Mozilla Corporation we increased the representation of Black/African Americans in the US from 4.8% to 7.8% and increased representation of women from 33.5% to 37.0%.</li>
            <li>At the Mozilla Foundation, we increased representation of Black/African Americans in the US from 5.7% to 8.3% and we increased representation of Hispanic/Latinx in the US from 5.7% to 8.3%.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expanded outreach and advocacy:</strong>
          <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
            <li>Garnered 18,000 hours of donated voice recordings in over 100 languages for Mozilla Common Voice, an initiative to help diversify voice data sets.</li>
            <li>Hosted our first-time-zone agnostic MozFest, going “live” over 20 hours a day. We welcomed over 9,500 participants from 143 countries around the world, increasing global majority participation by over 2000%.</li>
            <li>Engaged three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and over 20 students in curriculum exploring ethical computing practices.</li>
            <li>Partnered with an HBCU and HBCU consortium to launch a speaker series at MozFest and develop projects as part of our global Trustworthy AI Working Group.</li>
            <li>Hosted 15 Dialogues & Debates panels where 75% of speakers were women and over 50% were people of color. These leaders discussed biased algorithms; how AI in our daily lives reinforces historical power imbalances across gender, race, and class; and how to build better data stewardship models that return value to communities.</li>
            <li>Awarded $260,000 in funding through the Creative Media Awards for Black artists who use art to spotlight how AI can reinforce — or disrupt — systems of oppression.</li>
            <li>Increased our curated content in Pocket with 10 new collections celebrating heritage, historic moments, and social justice movements resulting in 217,000 views.</li>

      <h3><span class="highlight black">Looking Forward in 2022</span></h3>
      <p>In 2021, we continued to build upon our three-pillar strategy
        <strong>(who we are, what we build, and what we do beyond products)</strong> and approached our efforts with a spirit of innovation, experimentation, and impact. We were inspired by Mozillians and their dedication to creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace and world.
      </p>
      <p>Our commitment to diversity and inclusion does not stop with our Racial Justice Commitments nor our progress over the past few years. In 2022, we will enhance our focus in the following areas: </p>
      <h4>Who we are</h4>
