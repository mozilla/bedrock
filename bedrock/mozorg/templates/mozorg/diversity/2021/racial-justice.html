      <h2><span class="highlight violet">Racial justice commitments update</span></h2>
      <p>In June 2020, spurred by the racist events occurring in the United States and in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, we set <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/first-steps-toward-lasting-change/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">our racial justice commitments</a>. These commitments were a first step toward lasting change and were meant to be measured at the end of 2021. Approximately one year after publishing our Racial Justice Commitments, we documented our progress <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozilla-racial-justice-commitments-one-year-in/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">one year in</a>. We set aggressive targets to ignite momentum and encourage innovation. While we did not meet all of our goals, we were encouraged by Mozillians interest in engaging, learning, and taking action within their sphere of influence and beyond. The framework offered by our racial justice commitments — <strong>“who we are, what we build, and what we do beyond products”</strong> — continues to guide our work. </p>
