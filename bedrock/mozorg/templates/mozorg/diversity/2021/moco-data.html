        <h3><span class="highlight black">Gender</span></h3>
        <p>Women make up a little over one-third of the Mozilla Corporation’s workforce, a 3.5 percentage point increase from 2020 to 2021. The hiring rate of women outpaces the rate of departures with women representing 46.8% of hires and 36.4% of departures. We continue to move closer toward achieving gender parity in leadership with women now representing 48.4% of leadership roles, a 2.4% increase since last year. Our continued focus on our recruitment and retention efforts to increase women in technical roles has resulted in a 4.2% increase of women in technical roles from 2020 to 2021.</p>

        <h3><span class="highlight black">Race and ethnicity (U.S. Only)</span></h3>

        <p>In 2021, the percentage of Black/African-American Mozillians increased from 4.8% at the onset of the year to 7.8% by the end of the year. Black/African-Americans in technical roles increased from 3.1% to 5.8% and in leadership roles increased from 9.3% to 9.6%. We did not see the same level of growth in the Hispanic/Latinx employee base. Hispanic/Latinx Mozillians accounted for 4.3% of the US employee base and 4.1% in technical roles which was 4.1% and 3.7% in 2020 respectively. Hispanic/Latinx members of the leadership group rose from 1.9% in 2020 to 3.8% in 2021. While we had good representation in our hiring rate, we saw that we were not able to retain Hispanic/Latinx employees to the extent we would have liked. Similarly for Asian Mozillians, we saw a year-over-year decrease in representation from 16.5% in 2020 to 16% in 2021. Leadership representation dropped from 18.5% to 15.4%. Both of these were mostly driven by the 20% attrition rate.</p>

        <li>All diversity data are self-reported and come from the Mozilla Corporation and Foundation’s Human Resources Information System for regular employees as of December 31, 2021. Progress over 12 months is compared against December 31, 2020.</li>
        <li>Staff at the Mozilla Corporation includes only regular, full-time employees. Staff at the Mozilla Foundation includes regular, full-time employees and fixed-term employees, as some fixed-term staff are tied to grants or specific funding sources.</li>
        <li>Currently, less than 1% of Mozilla Corporation employees select “other gender identities.” We recognize that gender identities exist on a spectrum.</li>
        <li>In order to be in compliance with global laws, we do not track race and ethnicity outside of the United States at this time. All race and ethnicity data are for employees in the United States only, and categories are driven by United States government requirements for disclosure.</li>
        <li>Leadership representation excludes executive-ranked technical fellows and only includes all levels of directors, vice presidents, and the executive team.</li>
        <li>Technical workers are defined as staff working on our products and within IT.</li>
        <li>Only voluntary departures are included in attrition calculations.</li>
        <li>Employees who decline to provide demographic data are not included in the metrics provided.</li>
        <li>Some categories may not add up to 100% if fields were left blank or listed as “other.”</li>
