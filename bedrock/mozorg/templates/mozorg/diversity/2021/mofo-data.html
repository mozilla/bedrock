        <p>Women continued to make up a little over two-thirds of the Mozilla Foundation employee base. The directors and executive team were primarily comprised of women, with 61.5% of leadership roles staffed by women, up more than 4 percentage points. Individuals with other gender identities now make up nearly 8% of leadership roles. Men represent roughly 44% of hires and roughly 57% of departures.</p>

        <h3><span class="highlight black">Intersection of gender and job level</span></h3>
        <p>Women continue to make up a significant majority of employees within the Foundation. Men and women are generally similarly distributed across most job levels with most roles falling between L14 to L16. We see women and men near parity at the highest senior leadership levels (L18 to L20). This suggests that despite the higher representation of women at the organization, men are overrepresented in the highest senior leadership levels in relation to their overall representation at the organization. There is a similar over-representation of women at the more junior or entry levels (L11 to L13), with women representing roughly 9% of roles and men representing 1.3%. Ultimately, there is an opportunity to pursue a more equitable gender distribution across job levels.</p>

      <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
        <li>All diversity data are self-reported and come from the Mozilla Corporation and Foundation’s Human Resources Information System for regular employees as of December 31, 2021. Progress over 12 months is compared against December 31, 2020.</li>
        <li>Staff at the Mozilla Corporation includes only regular, full-time employees. Staff at the Mozilla Foundation includes regular, full-time employees and fixed-term employees, as some fixed-term staff are tied to grants or specific funding sources.</li>
        <li>Currently, less than 1% of Mozilla Corporation employees select “other gender identities.” We recognize that gender identities exist on a spectrum.</li>
        <li>In order to be in compliance with global laws, we do not track race and ethnicity outside of the United States at this time. All race and ethnicity data are for employees in the United States only, and categories are driven by United States government requirements for disclosure.</li>
        <li>Leadership representation excludes executive-ranked technical fellows and only includes all levels of directors, vice presidents, and the executive team.</li>
        <li>Technical workers are defined as staff working on our products and within IT.</li>
        <li>Only voluntary departures are included in attrition calculations.</li>
        <li>Employees who decline to provide demographic data are not included in the metrics provided.</li>
        <li>Some categories may not add up to 100% if fields were left blank or listed as “other.”</li>
