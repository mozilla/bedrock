         <h3 class="c-subtitle"><strong>Our employee base and our communities</strong></h3>
         <p>As a global organization, we are committed to building a workforce that is representative of the communities we serve and the world we live in. We also recognize that building a representative workforce is only the beginning, so we are equally committed to fostering an inclusive culture in which all feel they belong and are empowered to do their best work.</p>

            <h3><span class="highlight black">Diversifying our talent network</span></h3>
            <p><strong>Mozilla employees spent over 300 hours volunteering as program mentors, event representatives, and speakers.</strong></p>
            <h4>Outreachy</h4>
            <p>Since 2013, Mozilla has participated in the Outreachy program, which aims to increase participation from underrepresented groups in free and open-source software. All Outreachy participants work remotely with their Mozilla mentors, allowing for a geographically diverse group of interns. Round 23 was hosted from May through August 2021, and we recently welcomed Round 24 participants for the December 2021 through March 2022 cohort, with interns hailing from Australia, Germany, Nigeria, and Pakistan.</p>
            <h4>Virtual career fairs</h4>
            <p>Mozilla engaged in a few regional or discipline-specific virtual hiring events, including REFACTR.TECH, the AUC Data Science Symposium, and Blacks in Technology x Techqueria Career Fair. We found the virtual conferences were a hit with Mozillians. Mozilla staff were able to diversify their own professional networks while connecting candidates to open positions.</p>

            <h3><span class="highlight black">Building community and connections</span></h3>
            <h4>Mozilla resource groups</h4>
            <p>Mozilla resource groups (MRGs) are internal networks where people can find connection and community across different experiences and backgrounds. These groups have formed organically over the years through employee interest, and nearly one-third of all Mozilla employees belong to at least one MRG. We believe our growing list of MRGs — Afrozillians, Disability@Mozilla, LatinPride, MozAPI, Pridezilla, and WoMoz — are critical to our success as an organization and our journey toward inclusion. In 2021, our MRGs sought to define themselves and determine how to show up in a way that was authentic to their experiences. MRG members also had access to learning and development opportunities, including group leadership coaching, and introductory chats to build their networks. It was also a year of firsts for our MRGs, with the founding of MozAPI, Disability@Mozilla, and Pridezilla_allies.</p>
            <h4>Inside Mozilla MRGs</h4>
            <p>We believe the best way to understand these groups is through the people in them. Read along as MRG members share what they’ve learned and what they are looking forward to.</p>

            <h4>Celebratory months</h4>
            <p>Mozillians celebrate and acknowledge the cultural diversity and heritages that form the tapestry of our organization. Throughout the year during celebratory awareness months and days, our MRGs, in concert with our centralized Diversity and Inclusion team, curate guides that take participants on a unique learning journey to understand different cultures and experiences. Our celebrations typically feature learning resources, custom Zoom expressions, co-created playlists for internal meetings and personal use, cooking classes, dance classes, and family-friendly fun.</p>

            <p>
               In 2021, as the pandemic continued on, the “great resignation” began, and a general feeling of exhaustion set in. Continuing wellness days was a clear necessity and we had an opportunity to raise the bar. In addition to offering one wellness day each month, the People and leadership teams set their sights on a wellness week. Instead of the annual in-person All Hands, we identified one week in July for company-wide paid time off. The response from Mozilla employees was overwhelmingly positive; employees cited the program as a clear indication that Mozilla cares about them.

               At the Mozilla Foundation, a 3-day weekend policy, known as “Summer Fridays” was instituted in 2020. This policy was originally designed to address the stress and disruptions caused by COVID-19. Feedback from staff indicated there were significant benefits to work and home life and the policy was expanded in 2021 to include 9 Fridays over July and August.

MozAPI, Mozilla’s resource group for Asian and Pacific Islanders, held events and created resources to honor, explore, and acknowledge the breadth of experiences across Asia and the Pacific Islands. Celebrations included a music lounge featuring Filipino American artist Jessica Lousie and a cooking class on the classic Filipino dish, chicken adobo. To bring the beauty of Asian American art to our fingertips, MozAPI created a Slack-bot that showcased different pieces of art from the Asian American Art Museum. Panel discussions were held to examine the impact of the model minority myth and explore the variety of ethnicities within Asia and the Pacific Islands. A facilitated discussion was also held to contend with the surge in physical and emotional violence against people of Asian descent in the U.S.

                  In 2021, LGBTQIA+ staff carefully considered how to honor Pride, and the consensus was clear: avoid anything that could be perceived as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing_(LGBT)" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">pinkwashing</a>. Because we are committed to an internet that promotes civil discourse, human dignity, and individual expression, we didn’t want Pride to be about promoting ourselves. Instead, we focused on connecting with and celebrating one another across Mozilla. Over the course of the month, we hosted movie nights highlighting diverse experiences within the LGTBQIA+ community, provided two pronoun trainings for Mozillians, and held a panel discussion featuring LGBTQIA+ staff at Mozilla. Prominent LGBTQIA+ activists, researchers, and technologists convened for the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/pride-the-internet-and-the-pandemic-a-june-22-virtual-panel/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Dialogues & Debates</a> speaker series. We discussed how the internet has intersected with their careers and community — especially during the last year, in which the pandemic forced so much of life online. We also hosted a Q&A with author of The Queer Bible, Jack Guinness, where he shared his inspiration for the book (see Jack’s <a href="https://getpocket.com/collections/my-joy-list-jack-guinness" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Pocket collection</a> featuring queer creators).

                  In 2021, the LatinPride MRG chose to honor Hispanic Heritage Month by exploring themes around language and identity. Through the cultural guide we designed, we examined the many ways our community members may choose to identify (Tejano, Afro-Latino, Hispanic, Taíno, Chicano, Latinx, Indigenous) and the implications of growing up either speaking Spanish or not. Mozilla employees with diverse Hispanic heritage and backgrounds led a panel discussion to explore how language shaped their collective experiences. The month also featured over 30 events across various regions including a cooking class in Mexico City, Spanish language lessons, Tango lessons, and an immersive tour of Hispanic and Latinx art.

The group chose to focus on creating a culture of allyship and identifying reliable bias reporting tools. The RJAAG helped us determine that our current tools sufficiently meet the needs of our organization but need additional process improvement. The RJAAG also played an instrumental role in helping shape and define the pilot for the Inclusion Champions program, including defining goals of the program, criteria, and review.

                  In 2021, Mozillians were invited to apply for the pilot Inclusion Champions Program. Through this immersive learning experience, we invited participants to learn critical skills for allyship to serve as change agents within the organization. Inclusion Champions spend six months in a learning cohort exploring topics related to DEI in the workplace. They participate in over 20 hours of multi-modal learning, including workshop sessions and reflection exercises. At the conclusion of the program, champions define an ally action and bring their learning to the broader Mozilla community in the form of workshops, discussion sessions, resource creation, and more.

                  In 2021, the D&I team convened the first Global DEI Council. Mozilla’s Global DEI Council (GDEIC) included over 40 members across every major business unit across Mozilla. The GDEIC served as connective tissue between DEI-related efforts happening across the organization. We held the first Global DEI Council Retreat, over four days where we explored a framework for creating inclusive cultures and grounded ourselves in a general understanding of DEI work underway at Mozilla. We examined our internal DEI-related data to gain an understanding of how we measure diversity and inclusion, explored the DEI landscape across tech to examine trends and innovative solutions, and workshopped ideas to define strategic actions for strengthening our DEI strategy.

                  In 2021, Mozilla began hosting Gather@ sessions. These facilitated discussions were designed to provide Mozillians with an opportunity to engage in deep listening and sharing following the onslaught of white supremacist violence, police brutality, and mass shootings occurring across the United States. These sessions gave us an opportunity to collectively process some of the traumatic and triggering events happening around us. Mozillians were invited to join if they were impacted or wanted to show support as allies.

               <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">
                  In 2021, and in partnership with <a href="https://www.mmg.earth/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">MMG</a> consulting firm, the Mozilla Foundation completed its first Racial Equity and Belonging Audit (REBA). Through interviews, policy and process review, surveys, workshops, and a collaborative decision-making process with key stakeholders, we aligned on four priority focus areas to guide our efforts in becoming a more equitable, inclusive force in the world:
               <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
                  <li>Well-being of Women of Color and the state of racial justice</li>
                  <li>Governance structure for accountability and trust</li>
                  <li>Equity in employment and compensation</li>
                  <li>Addressing conflict, confronting harm, seeking repair.</li>
               </ol>
               </p>
               <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">
                  The Foundation is hiring a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Lead to report to the Executive Director, and will invest in putting the REBA into action at multiple levels:
               <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
                  <li><span class="bold-item">Organizational:</span> creating a culture and structure that reflects a commitment to equity and belonging.</li>
