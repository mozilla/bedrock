    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Mozilla currently relies on a number of open source and free software
      projects.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      In some cases the software produced by these projects is incorporated into
      Mozilla products.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      In other cases we run it as part of our infrastructure, or Mozillians use it
      to get their jobs done.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      The Foundational Technology track is open to such projects who are in need
      of funds.
    {% endtrans %}

    <h2 class="moss-section-heading">What your application should include</h2>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Applications should be jointly submitted by the leader of a project and an
      established Mozillian who will champion the award.
    {% endtrans %}

      Your application needs to meet the following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul class="moss-list moss-list-third">
      <li>
        <h3 class="moss-section-subhead">Financial Request</h3>

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          Award requests should be for the amount of financial support needed to
          accomplish a clear and current project goal.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          Projects that don’t have a need for funds at this time can be considered
          when such a need arises.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          A $10,000 award request is just as valid as a $50,000 or $100,000
          request.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          The money must be used to benefit the project, but it does not have to
          be used on things which themselves would directly benefit Mozilla.
        {% endtrans %}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="moss-section-subhead">Project Origin</h3>

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          The project’s home can be anywhere in the world where we can make
          payment without undue burden.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          We have a reasonably strong preference for funding legal organizations
          rather than individuals representing projects, although exceptional
          circumstances could lead to some flexibility.
        {% endtrans %}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="moss-section-subhead">Champion Involvement</h3>

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          The Mozillian champion may be (but does not need to be) a project
          contributor to the project they are championing.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          The Mozillian champion must vouch for the usefulness of the software,
          commit to monitoring the project, and report on the effectiveness of the
          award after the money is spent.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          They will also make themselves available to the application evaluation
          committee to help them assess the appropriateness of the award to the
          needs of the project.
        {% endtrans %}
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      We expect the vast majority of MOSS awards to be singular rather than
      regular — that is, support for doing a particular defined thing, rather than
      ongoing support for a project in general.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      However a previous award proposal, successful or unsuccessful, does not
      disqualify a project from applying again.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      The minimum award for the Foundational Technology track is $10,000, and the
      maximum is $250,000.
    {% endtrans %}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mzp-l-content moss-section">
    <h2 class="moss-section-heading">How we’ll make our decision</h2>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      All criteria are indicative rather than determinative — that is to say, they
      will make us more or less likely to make an award, but none will guarantee a
      particular outcome.
    {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      Selection criteria:
    </p>

    <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
      <li>
        How reliant is Mozilla on the project’s technology?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do others also rely on it outside of Mozilla products?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the technology unique?
        Are they doing something different?
      </li>
      <li>
        What role does the project play in the open source ecosystem?
      </li>
      <li>
        {% trans %}
          What sort of reputation does the project have in general, if any?
        {% endtrans %}

        <ul>
          <li>
          {% trans %}
            This includes reputation in technical, inclusion and other areas
          {% endtrans %}
          </li>
          <li>
          {% trans %}
            Is the project known for something besides the code we are relying on?
          {% endtrans %}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Will this award make a significant impact on the project?
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Is the level of funding appropriate for the task to be accomplished?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Does the person (or group) who will receive the money have a track record
        of delivering?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        What does the champion have to say?
        Is the case compelling?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="mzp-l-content moss-section">
    <h2 class="moss-section-heading">What a Mozilla champion does</h2>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Applications need to be jointly submitted by the project and a Mozilla
      Champion.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      A Champion is an established member of the Mozilla community who knows the
      project concerned.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      Being a champion means you believe in the project and its impact.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      You believe that funds from a MOSS Award would make a meaningful difference
      in the success and effectiveness of the project.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      You believe the range of funds requested in the Award proposal is
      appropriate.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      And you believe that the project and the task fit the award criteria for the
      track you are applying for.
    {% endtrans %}
    </p>

    <p>
      A champion does a few different things:
    </p>

    <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        sponsors the project’s award proposal (it is akin to vouching for
        someone);
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        serves as the liaison between that project and Mozilla with regard to
        the award;
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        reviews the effectiveness of the award funds after an agreed upon period,
        to help Mozilla improve the effectiveness and impact of the MOSS program.
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      This review process might involve answering a set of standard assessment
      questions at the mid-point and at the end of the award period, and giving
      your written opinion of the overall success of the award.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      The time commitment should not be massive, but it will require
      thoughtfulness and honesty.
    {% endtrans %}

    <dl class="mzp-u-list-styled">
      <dt>
      {% trans %}
        What if my project doesn’t have a legal organizational home?
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        I see this is disfavored, and exceptional circumstances are required.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        What might count as “exceptional”?
      {% endtrans %}
      </dt>

      <dd>
      {% trans %}
        You tell us.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        If a project doesn’t have a legal organizational home, we will be handing
        a large sum of money to an individual with only limited accountability.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        This means a higher level of complexity and risk.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        So you need to describe why it’s reasonable and important for us to accept
        that additional risk.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        We will listen because Mozilla is a pretty flexible organization, but we
        can’t promise the result will be as you hope.
      {% endtrans %}
      </dd>

      <dt>
        What about tax?
      </dt>

      <dd>
      {% trans %}
        Recipients are responsible to determine the tax implications of receiving
        an award, based on their respective countries’ tax laws and compliance
        requirements.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        Amounts applied for should be sized such that any tax or other liability
        that will be incurred is accounted for.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        Mozilla reserves the right to use different payment mechanisms or tax
        characterizations for different awards in the MOSS program based on a
        number of factors specific to the award.
