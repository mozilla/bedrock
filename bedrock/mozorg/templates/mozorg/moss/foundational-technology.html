    {% trans %}
      Mozilla currently relies on a number of open source and free software
      projects.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      In some cases the software produced by these projects is incorporated into
      Mozilla products.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      In other cases we run it as part of our infrastructure, or Mozillians use it
      to get their jobs done.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      The Foundational Technology track is open to such projects who are in need
      of funds.
    {% endtrans %}

      established Mozillian who will champion the award.

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          Award requests should be for the amount of financial support needed to
          accomplish a clear and current project goal.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          Projects that don’t have a need for funds at this time can be considered
          when such a need arises.

        {% trans %}
          A $10,000 award request is just as valid as a $50,000 or $100,000
          request.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          The money must be used to benefit the project, but it does not have to
          be used on things which themselves would directly benefit Mozilla.

          payment without undue burden.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          We have a reasonably strong preference for funding legal organizations
          rather than individuals representing projects, although exceptional
          circumstances could lead to some flexibility.

          contributor to the project they are championing.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          The Mozillian champion must vouch for the usefulness of the software,
          commit to monitoring the project, and report on the effectiveness of the
          award after the money is spent.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          They will also make themselves available to the application evaluation
          committee to help them assess the appropriateness of the award to the
          needs of the project.

        </p>
      </li>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      We expect the vast majority of MOSS awards to be singular rather than
      regular — that is, support for doing a particular defined thing, rather than
      ongoing support for a project in general.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans %}
      However a previous award proposal, successful or unsuccessful, does not
      disqualify a project from applying again.

      The minimum award for the Foundational Technology track is $10,000, and the
      maximum is $250,000.

      A Champion is an established member of the Mozilla community who knows the

    {% trans %}
      You believe the range of funds requested in the Award proposal is
      appropriate.
