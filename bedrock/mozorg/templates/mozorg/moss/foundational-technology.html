    Mozilla currently relies on a number of open source and free software
    projects.
  {% endtrans %}

  {% trans %}
    In some cases the software produced by these projects is incorporated into
    Mozilla products.
  {% endtrans %}

  {% trans %}
    In other cases we run it as part of our infrastructure, or Mozillians use it
    to get their jobs done.
  {% endtrans %}

  {% trans %}
    The Foundational Technology track is open to such projects who are in need
    of funds.
