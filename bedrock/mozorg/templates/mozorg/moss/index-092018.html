        MOSS applications are accepted on a rolling basis and are reviewed monthly. Depending on when your application is received in our review cycle, it may take up to two months to receive committee feedback.

    <dd>
      <p>
      {% trans %}
        While there is no set range, historically, the MOSS Committee has mostly chosen to award between $5,000 and $150,000 USD per project. The larger the award, the more questions the committee will have regarding how the money will be used. All projects should include a statement of work that helps the committee understand how the amount of funding requested was determined and how that funding maps to specific tasks.

      {% trans %}
        Historically, the MOSS Committee has mostly chosen to fund projects which can demonstrate some success and momentum with regard to acquiring users and building an active community of contributors. If you are a new project that is just starting out or if you don’t yet have reliable information on how many users/contributors you have, we encourage you to clearly articulate your plans for growing your user base and contributor community.

      {% trans %}
        The MOSS Committee is happy to consider any open source project, including but not limited to software, hardware, firmware, design, and networking projects. All projects must generally involve some amount of technical development. MOSS does not sponsor conferences and events.

      {% trans %}
        The award amount you request should be determined by the scope of work that you wish to complete using your MOSS award. Your application should contain a rough scope of work, including an expected number of hours and hourly rates to complete each task.

        Direct costs are expenses directly attributable to the scope of work described in your request. Generally, direct costs would not be incurred if the proposed scope of work did not exist. Direct costs may include staff salaries, contractors/consultants, and materials required to execute the scope of work.

      <p>
      {% trans %}
        Indirect costs are those costs not readily identified with a specific project/activity but incurred for the joint benefit of multiple projects/activities. Indirect costs are usually grouped into common pools and charged to benefiting objectives through an allocation process/indirect cost rate. Indirect costs include expenses frequently referred to as overhead (rent, utilities, general and administrative expenses, etc.
