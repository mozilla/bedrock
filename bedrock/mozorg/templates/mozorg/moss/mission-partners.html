          The project should be to write or enhance some software or software
          documentation which is under an OSI open source and/or an FSF free

          Activities which are not sufficient for an award on their own include:
          writing open source software (notwithstanding manifesto principle #7);
          building something cool with web technologies; and translating open
          source software into another language.

          The project should benefit Mozilla’s mission.
        {% endtrans %}

        {% trans %}
          This is normally demonstrated by tying the objective of the project to
          specific Mozilla manifesto principles or other demonstrated priorities.

      We expect the vast majority of MOSS awards to be singular rather than
      regular — that is, support for doing a particular defined thing, rather than
      ongoing support for a project in general.

    {% trans %}
      However a previous award proposal, successful or unsuccessful, does not
      disqualify a project from applying again.

      The minimum award for the Mission Partners track is $10,000, and the maximum
      is $250,000.
