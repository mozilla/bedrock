        Mozilla was born out of and remains part of the open source and free software
        movement. Through the Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) awards program, we
        recognize, celebrate, and support open source projects that contribute to
        Mozilla’s work and to the health of the Internet. MOSS broadens access, increases security, and empowers users by providing catalytic funding to open source technologists.

          MOSS applications are accepted on a rolling basis and are reviewed monthly. Depending on when your application is received in our review cycle, it may take up to two months to receive committee feedback.

        {% trans %}
          While there is no set range, historically, the MOSS Committee has mostly chosen to award between $5,000 and $150,000 USD per project. Awards of $150,000 and greater have historically been approved mostly for return awardees who have already successfully completed a smaller MOSS project. In general, the larger the award, the more scrutiny the application will receive and the more questions the committee will have regarding how the money will be used. All projects should include a statement of work that helps the committee understand how the amount of funding requested was determined and how that funding maps to specific tasks.

          Historically, the MOSS Committee has chosen to fund projects which are important in their ecosystems and can demonstrate some success and momentum with regard to acquiring users and building an active community of contributors. Unfortunately, the MOSS Committee does not consider applications from brand new projects, projects which are not open source, projects which have yet to be built or projects which have yet to build a community of users and contributors. If you are unsure if your project qualifies for MOSS funding, please <a href="{{ moss_email }}">email the MOSS team</a>.

        {% trans %}
          The MOSS Committee is happy to consider any open source project, including but not limited to software, hardware, firmware, design, and networking projects. All projects must generally involve some amount of technical development. MOSS does not sponsor conferences and events.

          The award amount you request should be determined by the scope of work that you wish to complete using your MOSS award. Your application should contain a rough scope of work, including an expected number of hours and hourly rates to complete each task.

          Direct costs are expenses directly attributable to the scope of work described in your request. Generally, direct costs would not be incurred if the proposed scope of work did not exist. Direct costs may include staff salaries, contractors/consultants, and materials required to execute the scope of work.

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          Indirect costs are those costs not readily identified with a specific project/activity but incurred for the joint benefit of multiple projects/activities. Indirect costs are usually grouped into common pools and charged to benefiting objectives through an allocation process/indirect cost rate. Indirect costs include expenses frequently referred to as overhead (rent, utilities, general and administrative expenses, etc.

          Recipients are responsible for determining the tax implications of receiving an award, based on their respective countries’ tax laws and compliance requirements. Amounts applied for should be sized such that any tax or other liability that will be incurred is accounted for. Mozilla reserves the right to use different payment mechanisms or tax characterizations for different awards in the MOSS program based on a number of factors specific to each award.
