      We have a series of factors we consider when evaluating an application.

    {% trans %}
      For example:
    {% endtrans %}

    <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

        {{ _('How commonly used is the software?') }}

      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Is the software network-facing or does it regularly process untrusted
        data?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        How vital is the software to the continued functioning of the Internet
        or the Web?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Is the project known for something besides the code we are relying on?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Does the software depend on closed-source code, e.g. in a web service?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Are the software’s maintainers aware of and supportive of the
        application for support from the SOS fund?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
      <li>
        {{ _('Has the software been audited before?') }}

        {{ _('If so, when and how extensively?') }}

        {{ _('Was the audit made public?') }}

        {{ _('If so, where?') }}
      </li>
      <li>
      {% trans %}
        Does the software have existing corporate backing or involvement?
      {% endtrans %}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    {% trans %}
      The answers to such questions are often not “yes” or “no”, but matters of
      degree, and so Mozilla will take the entire picture into account when
      assessing projects.

        We’ve been asked how this project compares to the Core Infrastructure
        Initiative of the Linux Foundation.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        Here’s a short answer:
      {% endtrans %}
      </dt>

      <dd>
      {% trans %}
        We believe our model of support is different from and complementary to
        CII’s.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        We view CII as focused on necessary, deeper-dive investments into the core
        OS security infrastructure, like in OpenSSL.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        This is important work.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        Focusing on more point-in-time solutions, the SOS Fund’s audit and
        remediation methodology targets a different class of OSS projects with
        lower-hanging fruit security needs, using an open public-facing
        application form.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        To have substantial and lasting benefit in tackling such a significant
        issue as open source security, we need a broad range of solutions,
        including investment, audits, education, best practices, and a host of
        others.
      {% endtrans %}

      {% trans %}
        We believe the SOS Fund, alongside CII and other efforts, can help
        catalyze industry momentum to strengthen open source security.
