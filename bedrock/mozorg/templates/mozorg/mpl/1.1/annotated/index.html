    <b>3.1. Application of License.</b>

    <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
    governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
    Section <b>2.2</b>. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
    distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
    this License released under Section <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a
    copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute.
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that
    alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
    recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional
    document offering the additional rights described in Section <b>3.5</b>.

        <span class="popup">
          This provision is intended to ensure availability of code, while

          Source Code to your Modifications with each Executable, as long as
          you make it available on-line and tell the recipient where it is.
          It does not require that you return Modifications to mozilla.org or
          any other named organization. However, you may do so if you choose,
          and we hope that you wish to participate in the development community
          that mozilla.org is chartered to foster.

    <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
    available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on
    the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
    Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
    available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
    must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
    initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
    version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
    remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
    maintained by a third party.</p>

    <b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b>

    <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file
    documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date
    of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
    provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
    Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
    version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
    ownership of the Covered Code.</p>

          (a) Third Party Claims.
          <span class="popup">
            We considered whether we should prohibit the use of any
            functionality where a contested intellectual property claim exists.
            But because these claims are often in contention, or unclear, or
            limited in their geographical scope so that they do not apply in
            some areas, we decided that this would limit the range of products
            that could be created from the Mozilla code too
            severely. Instead, we decided that contested intellectual property
            claims should be clearly disclosed so that each developer
            understands to the greatest extent possible the intellectual
            property issues surrounding the Source Code. This will help them to
            choose, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not they are interested
            enough in using the functionality to deal with the rights issues
            that surround that functionality.

      If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
      intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
      by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
      a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
      describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
      that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
      knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
      Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
      copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
      steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
      reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code

  <dd>
    <b>8.1.&nbsp;</b> This License and the rights granted hereunder will
    terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
    to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
    sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
    any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
    remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

    <p><b>8.2.&nbsp;</b> If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial
    Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
    whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")&nbsp; alleging
    that:</p>

    <p><b>(a)&nbsp;</b> such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
    upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
    within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)&nbsp; agree in
    writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for
    Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or
    (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
    Version against such Participant.&nbsp; If within 60 days of notice, a
    reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon
    in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the
    rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
    automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
    specified above.</p>

    <p><b>(b)</b>&nbsp; any software, hardware, or device, other than such
    Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
    patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
    2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made,
    used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
    Participant.</p>

    <p><b>8.3.&nbsp;</b> If You assert a patent infringement claim against
    Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
    or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
    by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
    litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
    Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
    determining the amount or value of any payment or license.</p>

    <p><b>8.4.</b>&nbsp; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or

    and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
    hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

    SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
    INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER

    STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter

    enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions

    which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
    registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation
    relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
    Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying
    in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
    costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable
    attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly

      RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
      <span class="popup">
        This section is designed to spread the burden of intellectual property
        claims made on Mozilla based code over the group of developers
        responsible for distributing copies of covered code that contain the
        offense that leads to the claim.

        <P>We believe wholeheartedly in the benefits of open source development,
        but not everyone does.  Some people or groups may try to take advantage
        of the work of open source development through claims of patent
        infringement. This is unfortunate, but it is also reality.  We suggest
        that you be aware of the intellectual property implications of what you
        are working on to protect yourself and others from falling afoul of
        someone else's patent.
