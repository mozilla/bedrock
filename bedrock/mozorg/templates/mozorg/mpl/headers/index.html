  <h1>Mozilla License Headers</h1>

  <section>
    <p>This page gives copy-and-pasteable license headers for Mozilla code. When adding license headers to new files to be checked in to the Mozilla source tree, always use the appropriate one of the following.</p>
    <h2>MPL 2</h2>
    <p>This license must be used for all new code, unless the containing project, module or externally-imported codebase uses a different license. If you can't put a header in the file due to its structure, please put it in a LICENSE file in the same directory.</p>
