However, new files containing no MPL-licensed code are not Modifications, and therefore do not need to be distributed under the terms of the MPL, even if you create a Larger Work (as defined in Section 1.7) by using, compiling, or distributing the non-MPL files together with MPL-licensed files. This allows, for example, programs using MPL-licensed code to be statically linked to and distributed as part of a larger proprietary piece of software, which would not generally be possible under the terms of stronger copyleft licenses.</p>"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "<p>Yes, by creating a \"Larger Work\" under the terms of Section 3.3. In particular, three requirements must be met:</p><ol><li><p>The software must not be “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses.” Software can become “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” in one of two ways: the original author marks it as such by adding the file header in Exhibit B, or the original author published the software under MPL 1.1 and did not dual- or tri-license the code with the (L)GPL.</p></li><li><p>The Larger Work must be \"a <strong>combination</strong> of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses.\" So you can't just say \"I really prefer (L)GPL\" - you must have a need to combine with another, existing GPL work. (This is different from a traditional dual-license, which does not require you to combine, and instead allows you to simply say \"I've decided to be GPL-only.\")</p></li><li><p>You must \"<strong>additionally</strong> distribute\" under (L)GPL. In other words, you must make the MPL-licensed source code available to your recipients under both MPL and (L)GPL. Someone downstream from your recipients can then take under (L)GPL-only or MPL-only. This is different from a traditional dual-license, which never requires publication under both licenses, and so always gives you the option of releasing incompatibly-licensed code.</p></li></ol><p>No GPL-compatible license can perfectly preserve the original author's ability to reuse downstream derivatives, but the last two restrictions serve to increase the probability that such reuse can occur in the broadest possible set of circumstances.</p><p>We have written <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/combining-mpl-and-gpl/\">a document</a> explaining how to do this in practical terms, i.e. what to do about license headers and so on.</p>"

"@type": "Question",
"name": "Does Sec. 3.3's ability to mix with other licenses lead to more license proliferation?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "<p>Mozilla's experience with MPL 1.1, and the experience of some of our advisors, was that in practice license incompatibility is often resolved by the use of custom additional permissions or dual- and tri- licenses. Each combination of dual or tri-license, or custom additional permissions, further complicates license interaction and proliferation analysis. We feel that Sec. 3.3, by replacing these ad-hoc solutions with a single, standardized solution for the most common situation, should reduce, rather than increase, the practical risk of license proliferation.</p>"

"name": "Is \"minified\" JavaScript Source Code?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "<p>No. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29\">Minified</a> JavaScript, while not an \"executable\" in the software engineering sense of the word, is difficult for humans to read, edit, and modify. As such, it is not \"the preferred form for modification\" and so it is not Source Code as defined by the license. Therefore, minified JavaScript is the Executable form, and the responsibilities set out in the license for distribution of the Executable form should be met when you distribute minified MPL-licensed JavaScript.</p><p>This means, among other things, that you do not need to, and probably should not preserve the MPL boilerplate (which begins \"This Source Code Form...\") when minifying JavaScript. However, you do need to comply with section 3.2(a) by informing the recipients of the minified source how they can obtain a copy of the source code. How exactly you do this will depend on how they can obtain that copy, but one way would be to include a comment with a link to the source code in either the page which uses the JavaScript or in the JavaScript file itself.</p><p>Note that treating minified JavaScript as an executable <em>increases</em> distributor flexibility by allowing MPL-licensed code to be combined into a single file with non-MPL JavaScript source code without requiring the non-MPL code to be distributed under the terms of the MPL.</p>"

"@type": "Question",
"name": "What does \"distribute\" mean?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "<p>The MPL uses \"distribute\" in the sense of delivery of a copy of the software to another person or entity. We do not use distribute to mean \"make available\" in the sense of \"making functionality available over the web without delivery of a copy of the software.\" So e.g. in a web-based application, the code which runs on the server is not 'distributed' to the user, but the code which is sent to the client (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript) does count as 'distributed'.</p>"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "<p>Yes but, as with MPL 1.1, <strong>we strongly discourage you from doing so</strong>. It will almost certainly make your software much less popular and less widely used. Software developers and companies are already aware of and understand popular licenses like the MPL. If you create your own, they will have to perform a legal assessment of your changes - and may conclude it's not worth the effort to do so. Or, you may accidentally make your software incompatible with the Free Software Definition or the Open Source Definition, or with the other commonly-used free software licenses that MPL 2.0 is compatible with.</p><p>If you like the MPL 2.0, just use it as-is - it is a clear, modern, internationalized, generic license. There is nothing Mozilla-specific, or specific to a particular country or project, in its licensing terms.</p><p>For more information on the problems that creating your own license causes, see the Wikipedia article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation\">license proliferation</a>.</p>"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "<p>The license notice must be in some way \"attached\" to each file. (Sec. 1.4.) In cases where putting it in the file is impossible or impractical, that requirement can be fulfilled by putting the notice somewhere that a recipient \"would be likely to look for such a notice,\" such as a LICENSE file in the same directory as the file. (Ex. A.) The license notice is as short as possible (3 lines) to make it easy to put in as many different types of files as possible.</p><p>While the license permits putting the header somewhere other than the file itself, individual files often end up being distributed on their own, without the rest of the software they were authored with. As a result, putting the license notice in the file is the surest way to ensure that recipients are always notified.</p><p>For your convenience, Mozilla has produced <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/headers/\">boilerplate headers</a> formatted with several common 'comment' syntaxes, suitable for copying and pasting.</p>"
