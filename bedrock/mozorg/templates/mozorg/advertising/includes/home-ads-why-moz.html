  <h3>Incremental Audience</h3>
  <p>Mozilla’s 220M+ global users are typically hard to reach. Nearly half avoid dominant social media and most say no to default platforms. They’re usually hidden behind ad blockers, but not on Mozilla’s surfaces. They’ll trust your ads because they trust us.</p>

  <h3>Brand Safe Spaces</h3>
  <p>Mozilla has ridiculously high standards. We refuse to put clutter in front of our users. And there’s no unwanted surprise placements or sketchy content next to your ads. This lets you cut through the noise, make a big impact, and keep your brand squeaky clean.</p>

  <h3>Actually Mission-Driven</h3>
  <p>Mozilla is reclaiming the internet by fixing what funds it, reinventing digital advertising from the inside. We’re creating an ad ecosystem built on trust, embedding respect, privacy, and performance into everything we do. </p>
