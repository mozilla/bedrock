  <p class="mozads-home-why-moz-list-text">Mozilla’s 210M+ global users are typically hard to reach. They're usually hidden behind ad blockers, nearly half avoid dominant social media, and most say no to default platforms. They’re selective, tech savvy, and paying attention.</p>

  <h3 class="mozads-home-why-moz-list-heading">Our spaces are brand-safe</h3>
  <p class="mozads-home-why-moz-list-text">Mozilla has ridiculously high standards. We refuse to put clutter in front of our users. And there’s no unwanted surprise placements or sketchy content next to your ads. This lets you cut through the noise, make a big impact, and keep your brand squeaky clean.</p>

  <h3 class="mozads-home-why-moz-list-heading">Our mission drives everything</h3>
  <p class="mozads-home-why-moz-list-text">Mozilla is fixing what funds the internet, reinventing digital advertising from the inside. We’re creating an ad ecosystem built on trust, embedding respect, privacy, and performance into everything we do.</p>
