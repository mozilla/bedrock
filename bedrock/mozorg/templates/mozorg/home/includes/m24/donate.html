      <p>Mozilla is building a movement to reclaim the internet. Together we can
        build a future where our privacy is protected, AI is trustworthy and
        irresponsible tech companies are held accountable. But that’s only
        possible if we do it together.</p>

      <p>We’re proudly non-profit. Will you donate to Mozilla today?</p>
