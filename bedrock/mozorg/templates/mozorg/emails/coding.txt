Hi,
I'm Josh, one of many Firefox developers. Glad to hear from you! Feel free to have a look at http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/#!/progornoprog/proglang if you're interested in joining a particular project or team. Meanwhile, I'll tell you about some general opportunities for writing code for Firefox.

To get started with the codebase, have a look at http://developer.mozilla.org/En/Introduction.

If you need any help, you can obtain it on IRC. I recommend visiting #introduction, which is specifically for newcomers. See http://irc.mozilla.org for how to access it.

Feel free to contact me anytime if you're having any problems! I'm jdm on IRC, or just josh@joshmatthews.net.

Happy hacking,
Josh
