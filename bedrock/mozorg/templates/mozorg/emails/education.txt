Here are a few resources to help you get started.

# Webmaker Mentors

Webmaker Mentors are fiercely unconventional  technologists, thinkers, and creators. We care about empowering everyone to be makers of the web â€“ and pushing the limits of what's possible online.

We help learners make amazing things on the web and level up their digital skills as they go. We promote radical inclusion and support learning anywhere - in our homes, offices, neighborhoods and online.

Please introduce yourself on our community mailing list. We don't bite!
