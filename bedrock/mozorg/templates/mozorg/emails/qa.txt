Hi,

There are lots of ways to help out with Mozilla QA! Here is a quick start list of tasks:

  * Sign up on the One and Done QA taskboard: https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/
  * Introduce yourself on irc: https://quality.mozilla.org/docs/misc/getting-started-with-irc/
  * Attend an Event: https://quality.mozilla.org/category/events/

Let me know what projects and tasks you would like to work on by signing up for One and Done and picking a task. Also, introduce yourself in IRC, so we can connect you with useful help from our team. We need help with many different QA projects such as Desktop Firefox, Firefox for Android, Firefox OS, Cloud Services, Thunderbird, Websites, and more. In these projects, we  need help on many different tasks such as running manual tests, writing test automation, and more.

We hope to hear back from you on how you can help us make Mozilla products better!

Sincerely,
Marcia Knous
