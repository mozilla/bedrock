I'm sorry to hear you're running into an issue with Firefox.

I would encourage you to ask about this on our Firefox Support site at

http://support.mozilla.org

There are experts there who can help you sort things out.

If you've tried that and haven't found a solution, you can write me back and I'll try to help.

Thanks,
David
