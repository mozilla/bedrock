Thank you for your interest in Firefox Add-ons. It's easy to start contributing--whether by leaving a review of your favorite add-on, designing a theme, or creating an add-on, your efforts matter!

If you are new to add-ons, here are some things you can do at https://addons.mozilla.org:

============================
REVIEW YOUR FAVORITE ADD-ONS
============================

Search for your favorite add-on at https://addons.mozilla.org. On the add-on's detail page, scroll down to the Reviews section and leave a comment for the developer.

====================
CREATE A COLLECTION
====================

Collections make it easy to keep track of favorite add-ons and share your perfectly customized browser with others. Get started here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/collections/

===============
CREATE A THEME

If you are interested in testing add-ons, you can join the quality team:

It's also helpful to install the Add-ons Compatibility Reporter and use it to let us know when an add-on is not working properly:

======================
HELP ADD-ON DEVELOPERS
======================

If you're already familiar with add-on development or you think you're a good technical writer, help us improve the documentation for add-on developers: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons

You can also help by translating these docs to a different language (pro tip: try replacing the en-US part of the link above to your native language code).
