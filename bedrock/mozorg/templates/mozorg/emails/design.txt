Thanks for your interest in getting involved with Mozilla.

Visual design is handled by our Creative team and we work on projects ranging from logos to marketing campaigns to websites to... well, just about anything and everything visual around here. If that sounds like something you’d like to be a part of, here are some next steps you can take:

* Follow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/mozcreative  — This is currently the main point of contact for visual design contributors at Mozilla. Aside from the regular stream of creative-related news, links to our blog posts and miscellaneous pieces of Internet interest, we'll be posting projects and design challenges for you to work on, so please be sure to follow us.

* Read our blog: https://blog.mozilla.org/creative/ — Learn more about the latest projects we're working on.

If you have questions or comments about any of this, please feel free to write back.
