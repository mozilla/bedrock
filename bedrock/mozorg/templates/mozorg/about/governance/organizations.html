<h1 class="mzp-c-article-title">Mozilla Organizations</h1>

<p>Mozilla is a global community of people <a href="{{ url('mozorg.mission') }}">creating a better Internet</a>. We build public benefit into the Internet by creating free, open source products and technologies that improve the online experience for people everywhere.</p>

<p>There are several organizations that support the Mozilla community and <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.manifesto') }}"> Mozilla’s principles.</a> They include the non-profit Mozilla Foundation as well as the wholly owned taxable subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Mozilla considers itself a <a href="http://commonspace.wordpress.com/category/hybrid/">hybrid organization</a>, combining non-profit and market strategies to ensure the Internet remains a shared public resource.</p>
