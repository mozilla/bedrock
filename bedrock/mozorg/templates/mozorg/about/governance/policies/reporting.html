    Reports are handled discretely and privately, and will only be shared with the people who can investigate, respond, and advise.

  {% endtrans %}

  <h3>{{ _('Correspondence') }}</h3>
  <p>

  <h3>{{ _('Redress') }}</h3>

  {% trans %}
    When an investigation is complete, to the extent the wrongdoer is subject to Mozilla’s control, appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

  <h3>{{ _('No Retaliation') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Mozilla does not tolerate retaliation against Mozillians who report concerns under the CPG in good faith. Acts of retaliation should be reported in the same process as described above.
