<section id="introduction">
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    The heart of Mozilla is people. We put people first and do our best
    to recognize, appreciate and respect the diversity of our global
    contributors. The Mozilla Project welcomes contributions from everyone
    who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive
    manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of
    conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere
    to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help us create
    a safe and positive community experience for all.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should
    feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others,
    regardless of:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul class="prose">
    <li>{{ _('Background') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Family status') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Gender') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Gender identity or expression') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Marital status') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Sex') }}</li>

    <li>{{ _('Religion') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Geographic location') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Any other dimension of diversity') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work —
    from development on Firefox to collaboratively designing curriculum. We
    gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those
    who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals
    and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document
    outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

<section id="when-to-use">
  <h2>{{ _('When and How to Use These Guidelines') }}</h2>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of
    the Mozilla community in all Mozilla activities, both offline and
    online. Your participation is contingent upon following these
    guidelines in all Mozilla activities, including but not limited to:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul class="prose">
    <li>{{ _('Working in Mozilla spaces.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Working with other Mozillians and other Mozilla community participants virtually or co-located.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Representing Mozilla at public events.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Representing Mozilla in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, Facebook pages).') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Participating in Mozilla offsites and trainings.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Participating in Mozilla-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person meetings, and Mozilla-related correspondence.') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  {% trans note1='#note-1' %}
    These guidelines work in conjunction with our Anti-Harassment/Discrimination
    Policies<a href="{{ note1 }}">[1]</a>, which sets out protections for, and obligations
    of, Mozilla employees. The Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy is crafted with
    specific legal definitions and requirements in mind.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans mailto_inclusion='mailto:inclusion@mozilla.com' %}
    If you experience behavior outside of Mozilla communities, in person
    or online, that makes participation in Mozilla not a safe and positive
    community experience for all, please contact us at
    <a href="{{ mailto_inclusion }}">inclusion@mozilla.com</a>. While these
    guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at Mozilla’s work and
    community, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of
    Mozilla’s online or inperson spaces  to have a deep impact on community
    health. (For example, in the past, we publicly identified an anonymous
    posting aimed at a Mozilla employee in a non-Mozilla forum as clear grounds
    for removal from the Mozilla community.) This is an active topic in the
    diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions
    among our communities about appropriate boundaries.
  {% endtrans %}

<section id="expected-behavior">
  <h2>{{ _('Expected Behavior') }}</h2>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    The following behaviors are expected of all Mozillians:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Be Respectful') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree,
    but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different
    possibilities and to being wrong. Be kind in all interactions and
    communications, especially when debating the merits of different options.
    Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting
    people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for
    your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed
    through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely,
    and correct the behavior going forward.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Be Direct but Professional') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is
    respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly
    when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold
    hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem
    to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient
    can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Be Inclusive') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams
    powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all
    voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find
    yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step
    back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time
    is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to
    contribute or participate when possible.
  {% endtrans %}

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating
    people’s participation whether they are:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul class="prose">
    <li>{{ _('Remote (on video or phone)') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Not native language speakers') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Coming from a different culture') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Living in a different time zone') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Facing other challenges to participate') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or
    participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back.
    Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Understand Different Perspectives') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more
    productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better.
    Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when
    different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Mozillians come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences
    can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal
    habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural
    practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases,
    prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from
    their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the
    appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and
    confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well
    as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know
    the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone
    needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive
    interactions.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Lead by Example') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans mission=url('mozorg.mission') %}
    By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others
    want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in
    ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes.
    Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and
    others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on
    the highest good for <a href="{{ mission }}">Mozilla’s mission</a>.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>
</section>

<section id="unacceptable-behavior">
  <h2>{{ _('Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated') }}</h2>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under
    these guidelines.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Violence and Threats of Violence') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or
    offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual,
    including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also
    includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally
    identifying information (“doxxing”) online.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Personal Attacks') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn
    into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle
    others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is
    not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree
    and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be
    conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the
    issue at hand.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Derogatory Language') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Hurtful or harmful language related to:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul class="prose">
    <li>{{ _('Background') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Family status') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Gender') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Gender identity or expression') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Marital status') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Sex') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Sexual orientation') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Native language') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Age') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Ability') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Race and/or ethnicity') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('National origin') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Socioeconomic status') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Religion') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Geographic location') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Other attributes') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone
    by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the
    legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if
    a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated
    subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop
    the behavior in question.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not
    acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in
    interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as
    inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. This includes
    touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas
    such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair,
    scooter, etc) or tattoos. This also includes physically blocking
    or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated
    physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative
    consent is not acceptable. This includes sharing or distribution
    of sexualized images or text.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <h3>{{ _('Disruptive Behavior') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including
    talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <ul class="prose">
    <li>{{ _('‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs
      to excess, or pushing others to do so.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from
      alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking about
      their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to
      drink - physically or through jeering.') }}</li>
    <li>{{ _('Otherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility
      in the session.') }}</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>{{ _('Influencing Unacceptable Behavior') }}</h3>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way
    we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences
    apply.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>
</section>

<section id="consequences">
  <h2>{{ _('Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior') }}</h2>
  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Bad behavior from any Mozillian, including those with decision-making
    authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people
    (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official
    action) from Mozilla activities are not acceptable and will be dealt
    with appropriately.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly
    investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space,
    event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address
    the situation.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans %}
    Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
    immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in you being
    ask to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for
    the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in
    spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.
  {% endtrans %}
  </p>

  <p>
  {% trans note1='#note-1' %}

  <p>
  {% trans %}
