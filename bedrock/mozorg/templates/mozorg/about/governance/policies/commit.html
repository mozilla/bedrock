<p>
{% trans policy=url('mozorg.about.governance.policies.commit.access-policy') %}
You will need one or more vouchers. The <a href="{{ policy }}">Commit Access Policy</a> sets out who is allowed to vouch, and it depends on what level of access you are requesting. Each voucher must already have commit access and be confident enough in you to be associated with your check-ins. Your vouchers are responsible for your bustages in the unfortunate event that you break things and leave. They are responsible for making sure you know and follow the rules in general, act promptly to fix regressions, are aware of and respect tree closures, etc. The vouchers' responsibility extends for three months after you are granted source code commit access. If you've lived in the tree without significant issues for three months, we assume you're ready to stand on your own. If somehow there are persistent problems during the first three months, the vouchers have the authority to request revocation of your access during this period. Vouching is a big responsibility, so people will make this commitment only after due consideration. A voucher who helps people who aren't prepared get access to the source tree will find that his or her own credibility suffers as well.

<h2 id="revoking-commit-access">{{ _('Revoking Commit Access') }}</h2>
<p>{{ _('If someone consistently causes difficulties with these source repositories due to poor behavior or other serious problems then commit access may be revoked. We have no precise process for this as it has been a rare or nonexistent problem to date. The process for this is for one or more committers with concerns to notify the owner of the Commit Access Policy sub-module if you have clear examples of someone whom you believe has reached this level of problem. Do not do so carelessly, or based on passing irritation or without a sense that you are not alone in your concerns. The Commit Access Policy owner will investigate or cause an investigation to occur, privately at first and perhaps completely privately.') }}</p>

<p>{{ _('If your account in a particular SCM is inactive for more than 6 months, it may be deactivated. However, the knowledge that you have achieved a particular level of access is retained. Therefore, getting your account reactivated is a simple matter of filing a bug asking IT to turn it back on. Such bugs should be dealt with extremely quickly.') }}</p>
