  <p>{{ _('Performance is a critical goal for Mozilla releases and the commercial products that will be based on Mozilla. We cannot allow performance regressions to go unnoticed or unresolved during our development cycles. When a regression is identified a bug will be filed and the patch author will be asked to provide information via the needinfo flag in bugzilla. We expect a response and reasonable dialog within 3 business days. In the unfortunate event that we cannot learn more about the regression, we will backout the offending patch(es) and the patch author can reland when they have more time to investigate.') }}</p>
