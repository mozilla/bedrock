  <p><em>Version 2.5</em></p>
  <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
    other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla includes with such software
    a set of X.509v3 root certificates for various Certification
    Authorities (CAs). The included certificates have their "trust bits"
    set for various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
    certificates to anchor a chain of trust for certificates used by SSL servers
    and S/MIME email users without having to ask users for further permission or
    information.</p>
  <p>This policy covers how the default set of certificates and associated trust
    bits is maintained for software products distributed by Mozilla. Other entities
    distributing software based on ours are free to adopt their own policies. In
    particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of
    such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates and modify the
    values of the trust bits in the versions that they distribute. However,
    as with other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor MAY
    well affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
    versions of the software. See the Mozilla trademark policy for more
    information.</p>
  <h3 id="scope">1.1 Scope</h3>
  <p>This policy applies, as appropriate, to certificates matching any of the
    following (and the CAs which control or issue them):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>CA certificates included in, or under consideration for inclusion in, the
        Mozilla root program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Intermediate certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate and which are not technically constrained to
        prevent issuance of working server or email certificates. Such technical
        constraints could consist of either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which does not contain any of
          these KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
          id-kp-emailProtection; or:</li>
        <li>name constraints which do not allow Subject Alternative Names (SANs) of
          any of the following types: dNSName, iPAddress, SRVName, rfc822Name</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>End-entity certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate through intermediate certificates which are all in
        scope, such end-entity certificates having either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which contains one or more of these
          KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
          id-kp-emailProtection; or:</li>
        <li>no EKU extension.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
  <h3 id="policy-ownership">1.2 Policy Ownership</h3>
  <p>Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#CA_Certificates">CA Certificate module owner</a>
    and peers to evaluate new CA requests on our behalf and make decisions
    regarding all matters relating to CA certificates included in our root program.</p>
  <p>Further, Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Mozilla_CA_Certificate_Policy">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy module
    owner</a> and peers to maintain this policy. The policy will
    only be changed after public consultation with the Mozilla community, in order
    to ensure that all views are taken into account. You can contact the Mozilla CA
    Certificate Policy module team at <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> if you
    have questions about this policy.</p>
  <p>CAs or others objecting to a particular decision by either team MAY appeal to
    the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Governance">Mozilla governance module owner</a> who will make a final
    decision.</p>
  <h2 id="certificate-authorities">2. Certificate Authorities</h2>
  <h3 id="ca-operations">2.1 CA Operations</h3>
  <p>CAs whose certificates are included in Mozilla's root program MUST:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>provide some service relevant to typical users of our software
      products;</li>
    <li>follow industry best practice for securing their networks, for example
      by conforming to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/network-security/">CAB Forum Network Security Guidelines</a> or a
      successor document;</li>
    <li>enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of causing
      certificate issuance or performing Registration Authority or Delegated
      Third Party functions, or implement technical controls operated by the CA
      to restrict certificate issuance through the account to a limited set of
      pre-approved domains or email addresses;</li>
    <li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate
      requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
      purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>
    <li>verify that all of the information that is included in SSL
      certificates remains current and correct at time intervals of
      thirty-nine months or less; and</li>
    <li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
      deem acceptable.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>CAs MUST follow and be aware of discussions in the
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#dev-security-policy">mozilla.dev.security.policy</a> forum, where Mozilla's root program is
    coordinated. They are encouraged, but not required, to contribute to those
    discussions.</p>
  <h3 id="validation-practices">2.2 Validation Practices</h3>
  <p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be acceptable if it
    meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>All information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
      MUST be verified by using an independent source of information
      or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
      the certificate.</li>
    <li>For a certificate capable of being used for digitally signing or encrypting
      email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that
      the entity submitting the request controls the email account
      associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
      <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
      the account holder’s behalf.</li>
    <li>For a certificate capable of being used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
      must ensure that the applicant has registered the domain(s) referenced
      in the certificate or has been authorized by the domain registrant to
      act on their behalf. This must be done using one or more of the 10
      methods documented in section 3.2.2.4 of version 1.4.1 (and not any
      other version) of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. The CA's
      CP/CPS must clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
      each documented procedure should state which subsection of 3.2.2.4 it is
      complying with. Even if the current version of the BRs contains a method
      3.2.2.4.11, CAs are not permitted to use this method.</li>
    <li>For certificates marked as Extended Validation, the CA MUST comply with the
      latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/">Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of
        Extended Validation Certificates</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="baseline-requirements-conformance">2.3 Baseline Requirements Conformance</h3>
  <p>CA operations relating to issuance of certificates capable of being used for
    SSL-enabled servers MUST also conform to the latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser
      Forum Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted
      Certificates</a> ("Baseline Requirements"). In the event of inconsistency
    between Mozilla’s Root Store Policy requirements and the Baseline Requirements,
    Mozilla’s Root Store Policy takes precedence. The following is a list of known
    places where this policy takes precedence over the Baseline Requirements. If
    you find an inconsistency that is not listed here, notify Mozilla so the item
    can be considered for addition or clarification.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Insofar as the Baseline Requirements attempt to define their own scope, the
        scope of this policy (section 1.1) overrides that. Mozilla thus requires CA
        operations relating to issuance of <strong>all</strong> SSL certificates in the scope of
        this policy to conform to the Baseline Requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mozilla reserves the right to accept audits by auditors who do not meet the
        qualifications given in section 8.2 of the Baseline Requirements, or refuse
        audits from auditors who do.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="documentation">3. Documentation</h2>
  <h3 id="audits">3.1 Audits</h3>
  <p>Before being included and periodically thereafter, CAs MUST obtain certain
    audits for their root certificates and all of their intermediate certificates
    that are not technically constrained to prevent issuance of working server or
    email certificates. This section describes the requirements for those audits.</p>
  <h4 id="audit-criteria">3.1.1 Audit Criteria</h4>

  <h4 id="audit-parameters">3.1.3 Audit Parameters</h4>
  <p>Full-surveillance period-of-time audits MUST be conducted and updated audit
    information provided no less frequently than <strong>annually</strong>. Successive audits
    MUST be contiguous (no gaps).</p>
  <p>Point-in-time audit statements may be used to confirm that all of the problems
    that an auditor previously identified in a qualified audit statement have been
    corrected. However, a point-in-time assessment does not replace the
    period-of-time assessment.</p>
  <p>Audit reports which are being supplied to maintain a certificate within the
    Mozilla root program MUST be provided to Mozilla via the CCADB within three
    months of the point-in-time date or the end date of the period.</p>
  <h4 id="public-audit-information">3.1.4 Public Audit Information</h4>
  <p>The publicly-available documentation relating to each audit MUST contain at
    least the following clearly-labelled information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>name of the company being audited;</li>
    <li>name and address of the organization performing the audit;</li>
    <li>Distinguished Name and SHA256 fingerprint of each root and intermediate
      certificate that was in scope;</li>
    <li>audit criteria (with version number) that were used to audit each of
      the certificates;</li>
    <li>a list of the CA policy documents (with version numbers) referenced during
      the audit;</li>
    <li>whether the audit is for a period of time or a point in time;</li>
    <li>the start date and end date of the period, for those that cover a period
      of time;</li>
    <li>the point-in-time date, for those that are for a point in time;</li>
    <li>the date the report was issued (which will necessarily be after the end
      date or point-in-time date); and</li>
    <li>For ETSI, a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit, and which
      parts of the criteria were applied, e.g. DVCP, OVCP, NCP, NCP+, LCP, EVCP,
      EVCP+, QCP-w, Part1 (General Requirements), and/or Part 2 (Requirements for
      trust service providers).</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="auditors">3.2 Auditors</h3>
  <p>In normal circumstances, Mozilla requires that audits MUST be performed
    by a Qualified Auditor, as defined in the Baseline Requirements section 8.2.</p>
  <p>If a CA wishes to use auditors who do not fit that definition, they MUST
    receive written permission from Mozilla to do so in advance of the start
    of the audit engagement. Mozilla will make its own determination as to
    the suitability of the suggested party or parties, at its sole discretion.</p>
  <h3 id="cps-and-cpses">3.3 CPs and CPSes</h3>
  <p>We rely on publicly disclosed documentation (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and
    Certification Practice Statement) to ascertain that our requirements are met.
    Therefore, the following MUST be true:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>the publicly disclosed documentation provides sufficient
        information for Mozilla to determine whether and how the CA
        complies with this policy, including a description of the steps
        taken by the CA to verify certificate requests;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>the documentation is available from the CA’s official website;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CPs and CPSes are made available to Mozilla under one
        of the following Creative Commons licenses (or later versions):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attribution (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a>) 4.0</li>
        <li>Attribution-ShareAlike (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>) 4.0</li>

        <li>Public Domain Dedication (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC-0</a>) 1.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>or a set of equally permissive licensing terms accepted by Mozilla in
        writing. If no such license is indicated, the fact of application is
        considered as permission from the CA to allow Mozilla and the public to
        deal with these documents, and any later versions for root certificates
        which are included in Mozilla's trust store, under CC-BY-ND 4.0.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>CPs and CPSes MUST be reviewed and updated as necessary at least once every
    year, as required by the Baseline Requirements. CAs MUST indicate that this has
    happened by incrementing the version number and adding a dated changelog entry,
    even if no other changes are made to the document.</p>
  <h2 id="common-ca-database">4. Common CA Database</h2>
  <p>Mozilla manages its root program using the Common CA Database (CCADB). CAs with
    certificates in Mozilla’s root program MUST use the CCADB, and are bound by the
    latest published version of the <a href="http://ccadb.org/policy">Common CCADB Policy</a>, which is
    incorporated here by reference.</p>
  <p>When required by the CCADB Policy, Mozilla’s root program may be contacted
    <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">by email</a>.</p>
  <p>Mozilla has requirements for the use of the CCADB above and beyond those in the
    CCADB Policy, as follows:</p>
  <h3 id="additional-requirements">4.1 Additional Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the revocation of an intermediate certificate chaining up to a root in
      Mozilla’s root program is due to a security concern, as well as performing the
      actions defined in the CCADB Policy, a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Mis-Issuance&amp;groups=crypto-core-security">security bug must be filed in
        Bugzilla</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="surveys">4.2 Surveys</h3>
  <p>Mozilla may conduct a survey of CAs from time to time using the CCADB. CAs are
    required to respond to the surveys with accurate information, within the
    timescale defined in the survey.</p>
  <h2 id="certificates">5. Certificates</h2>
  <h3 id="algorithms">5.1 Algorithms</h3>
  <p>Root certificates in our root program, and any certificate which
    chains up to them, MUST use only algorithms and key sizes from the following
    set:</p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <h4 id="sha-1">5.1.1 SHA-1</h4>
  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over end-entity certificates which chain
    up to roots in Mozilla's program only if all the following are true:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The end-entity certificate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>is not within the scope of the Baseline Requirements;</li>
        <li>contains an EKU extension which does not contain either of the
          id-kp-serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage key purposes;</li>
        <li>has at least 64 bits of entropy from a CSPRNG in the serial number.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The issuing certificate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contains an EKU extension which does not contain either of the
          id-kp-serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage key purposes;</li>
        <li>has a pathlen:0 constraint.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Point 2 does not apply if the certificate is an OCSP signing certificate
    manually issued directly from a root.</p>
  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over intermediate certificates which
    chain up to roots in Mozilla's program only if the certificate to be signed
    is a duplicate of an existing SHA-1 intermediate certificate with the
    only changes being all of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a new key (of the same size);</li>
    <li>a new serial number (of the same length);</li>
    <li>the addition of an EKU and/or a pathlen constraint to meet the
      requirements outlined above.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over OCSP responses only if the signing
    certificate contains an EKU extension which contains only the
    id-kp-ocspSigning EKU.</p>
  <p>CAs MAY sign SHA-1 hashes over CRLs for roots and intermediates
    only if they have issued SHA-1 certificates.</p>
  <p>CAs MUST NOT sign SHA-1 hashes over other data, including CT pre-certificates.</p>
  <h3 id="forbidden-and-required-practices">5.2 Forbidden and Required Practices</h3>
  <p>CA operations MUST at all times be in accordance with the applicable CP
    and CPS.</p>
  <p>CAs MUST maintain a certificate hierarchy such that the included
    certificate does not directly issue end-entity certificates to
    customers (i.e. the included certificate signs intermediate
    issuing certificates), as described in section 6.1.7 of the
    <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>
  <p>CAs MUST maintain current best practices to prevent
    algorithm attacks against certificates. As such, all new certificates
    MUST have a serial number greater than zero, containing at least 64 bits of
    output from a CSPRNG.</p>
  <p>CAs MUST NOT issue certificates that have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>
    <li>invalid public keys (e.g., RSA certificates with public exponent
      equal to 1);</li>
    <li>duplicate issuer names and serial numbers (except that a Certificate
      Transparency pre-certificate is allowed to match the corresponding
      certificate);</li>
    <li>incorrect extensions (e.g., SSL certificates that exclude SSL
      usage, or authority key IDs that include both the key ID and the
      issuer’s issuer name and serial number); <em>or</em>
    </li>
    <li>cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess extensions for
      which no operational CRL or OCSP service exists.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="intermediate-certificates">5.3 Intermediate Certificates</h3>
  <p>All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates, and
    which directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in Mozilla’s CA
    Certificate Program, MUST be operated in accordance with this policy and MUST
    either be technically constrained or be publicly disclosed and audited.</p>
  <p>A certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new
    certificates if it contains an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.1.4">X.509v3 basicConstraints extension</a>
    with the cA boolean set to true. The term "subordinate CA" in this section
    refers to any organization or legal entity that is in possession
    or control of a certificate that is capable of being used to
    issue new certificates.</p>
  <p>These requirements include all cross-certified certificates
    which chain to a certificate that is included in Mozilla’s CA
    Certificate Program.</p>
  <h4 id="technically-constrained">5.3.1 Technically Constrained</h4>
  <p>We encourage CAs to technically constrain all subordinate CA
    certificates. For a certificate to be considered technically
    constrained, the certificate MUST include an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage
      (EKU)</a> extension specifying all extended key usages that the
    subordinate CA is authorized to issue certificates for. The anyExtendedKeyUsage
    KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension.</p>
  <p>If the certificate includes the id-kp-serverAuth extended key usage,
    then the certificate MUST be Name Constrained as described in section
    7.1.5 of version 1.3 or later of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>
  <p>If the certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended key
    usage, it MUST include the Name Constraints X.509v3 extension with
    constraints on rfc822Name, with at least one name in permittedSubtrees,
    each such name having its ownership validated according to section
    3.2.2.4 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>
  <p>Instead of complying with the above paragraph, intermediate certificates
    issued before 22nd June 2017 may, until 15th January 2018, comply with the
    following paragraph:</p>
  <p>If the certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended
    key usage, then all end-entity certificates MUST only include
    e-mail addresses or mailboxes that the issuing CA has confirmed
    (via technical and/or business controls) that the subordinate CA
    is authorized to use.</p>
  <h4 id="publicly-disclosed-and-audited">5.3.2 Publicly Disclosed and Audited</h4>
  <p>We recognize that technically constraining subordinate CA
    certificates as described above may not be practical in some cases.
    All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
    certificates, that are not technically constrained, and that
    directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in
    Mozilla’s root program MUST be audited in accordance with
    Mozilla’s Root Store Policy and MUST be publicly disclosed in the
    CCADB by the CA that has their certificate
    included in Mozilla’s root program. The CA with a
    certificate included in Mozilla’s root program MUST
    disclose this information within a week of certificate creation, and
    before any such subordinate CA is allowed
    to issue certificates. All disclosure MUST be made freely available
    and without additional requirements, including, but not limited to,
    registration, legal agreements, or restrictions on redistribution of
    the certificates in whole or in part.</p>
  <h2 id="revocation">6. Revocation</h2>
  <p>CAs MUST revoke Certificates that they have issued upon the occurrence of any
    event listed in the appropriate subsection of section 4.9.1 of the Baseline
    Requirements, according to the timeline defined therein.</p>
  <p>CAs MUST maintain an online 24x7 repository mechanism whereby
    application software can automatically check online the current
    status of all unexpired certificates issued by the CA.</p>
  <p>For end-entity certificates, CRLs MUST be updated and reissued at least
    every seven days, and the value of the nextUpdate field MUST NOT be
    more than ten days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.</p>
  <p>For end-entity certificates, if the CA provides revocation information
    via an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>it MUST update that service at least every four days; and</li>
    <li>responses MUST have a defined value in the nextUpdate field, and it
      MUST be no more than ten days after the thisUpdate field; and</li>
    <li>the value in the nextUpdate field MUST be before or equal to the
      notAfter date of all certificates included within the
      BasicOCSPResponse.certs field or, if the certs field is omitted,
      before or equal to the notAfter date of the CA certificate which
      issued the certificate that the BasicOCSPResponse is for.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="root-store-changes">7. Root Store Changes</h2>
  <p>Changes that are motivated by a security concern such as certificate
    misissuance or a root or intermediate compromise MUST be treated as a
    security-sensitive, and a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Mis-Issuance&amp;groups=crypto-core-security">secure bug filed in Bugzilla</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="inclusions">7.1 Inclusions</h3>
  <p>We will determine which CA certificates are included in Mozilla's root program
    based on the benefits and risks of
    such inclusion to typical users of our products. We will consider adding
    additional CA certificates to the default certificate set upon request only by
    an authorized representative of the subject CA. We will make such decisions
    through a public process, based on objective and verifiable criteria.</p>
  <p>We will not charge any fees to have a CA’s certificate(s)
    included in Mozilla's root program.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to not include certificates from a particular CA in
    our root program. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
    where we believe that a CA has caused undue risks to users’
    security, e.g. by knowingly issuing certificates without the knowledge of the
    entities whose information is referenced in those certificates.</p>
  <p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to Mozilla's root program a CA
    SHOULD submit a formal request by submitting a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=mozilla.org&amp;component=CA%20Certificates">bug report</a>
    into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA
    Certificates" component of the "mozilla.org" product. Mozilla’s wiki
    page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>", provides
    further details about how to submit a formal request. The request
    MUST be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA, and
    MUST include the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
      certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>
    <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
      the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
      within the certificate hierarchy associated with the CA
      certificate:
      <ul>
        <li>SSL-enabled servers</li>
        <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
      issues Extended Validation certificates within the certificate hierarchy
      associated with the CA certificate and, if so, the EV policy
      OID associated with the CA certificate;</li>
    <li>a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (or
      links to a CP and CPS) or equivalent disclosure document(s)
      for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em>
    </li>
    <li>information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
      stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
      requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
      criteria.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
    information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
    request.</p>
  <h3 id="updates">7.2 Updates</h3>
  <p>Changes MAY be made to root certificates that are included in
    Mozilla's root program as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>enabling a trust bit in a root certificate that is currently
      included, may only be done after careful consideration of the
      CA’s current policies, practices, and audits,
      and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
    <li>enabling EV in a root certificate that is currently included,
      may only be done after careful consideration of the CA’s current
      policies, practices, and audits,
      and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
    <li>disabling a root is the act of turning off one or more of the
      trust bits (SSL or email), and may be
      requested by a representative of the CA or a representative of
      Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla
      system, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>;</li>
    <li>a representative of the CA or a representative of Mozilla may
      request that a root certificate be removed by submitting a bug
      report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the
      <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Root_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="removals">7.3 Removals</h3>
  <p>Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, decide to disable (partially or fully) or
    remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. This may happen
    immediately or on a planned future date. Mozilla will
    disable or remove a certificate if the CA demonstrates ongoing or
    egregious practices that do not maintain the expected level of service
    or that do not comply with the requirements of this policy.</p>
  <p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
    if we learn that a CA has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
    or more certificates. This may include, but is not limited to
    disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all of the CA’s
    certificates from Mozilla’s root program.</p>
  <p>The category of mis-issued certificates includes (but is not limited to) those
    issued to someone who should not have received them, those containing
    information which was not properly validated, those having incorrect technical
    constraints, and those using algorithms other than those permitted.</p>
  <p>A failure to provide notifications or updates in the CCADB or
    as otherwise required in a timely manner SHALL also be grounds for
    disabling a CA’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla's root
    program. For this policy and the CCADB policies, "a timely manner" means
    within 30 days of when the appropriate data or documentation becomes
    available to the CA, unless a Mozilla policy document specifies a different
    rule.</p>
  <p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
    root program based on a CA’s actions (or failure to act) that are
    contrary to the Mozilla Root Store Policy,
    Mozilla will publicize that fact in newsgroups on the
    news.mozilla.org server, on Web pages in the mozilla.org and
    mozilla.com domains, in news releases sent to organizations
    specializing in computer and Internet news, and/or as an alert to the
    US-CERT organization of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
  <h2 id="ca-operational-changes">8. CA Operational Changes</h2>
  <p>CAs SHOULD NOT assume that trust is transferable. All CAs whose certificates
    are included in Mozilla's root program MUST <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">notify Mozilla</a> if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ownership or control of the CA’s certificate(s) changes, or</li>
    <li>ownership or control of the CA’s operations changes; or</li>
    <li>there is a <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Material+Changes">material change</a> in the CA's operations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>CAs should err on the side of notification if there is any doubt. Mozilla will
    normally keep commercially sensitive information confidential. Throughout any
    change, CA operations MUST continue to meet the requirements of this policy. If
    one of the above events occurs, Mozilla MAY require additional audit(s) as a
    condition of remaining in the root program. CAs are encouraged to notify in
    advance in order to avoid unfortunate surprises.</p>
  <p>In addition, one or more of the following sections MAY apply.</p>
  <h3 id="change-in-legal-ownership">8.1 Change in Legal Ownership</h3>
  <p>This section applies when one company buys or takes a controlling stake in
    a CA, or when an organization buys the private key of a certificate in
    Mozilla's root program.</p>
  <p>Mozilla MUST be notified of any resulting changes in the CA's CP or CPS.</p>
  <p>If the receiving or acquiring company is new to the Mozilla root program, there
    MUST be a public discussion regarding their admittance to the root program,
    which Mozilla must resolve with a positive conclusion before issuance is
    permitted.</p>
  <h3 id="change-in-operational-personnel">8.2 Change in Operational Personnel</h3>
  <p>This section applies when operation of a certificate in Mozilla's root program
    is transferred to a different organization, whether by acquisition or contract.</p>
  <p>The transferor MUST ensure that the transferee is able to fully comply with
    this policy. The transferor will continue to be responsible for the root
    certificate's private key until Mozilla has been provided with an audit
    statement (or opinion letter) confirming successful transfer of the root
    certificate and key. Issuance MUST NOT occur until the transferee
    has provided all the information required by the CCADB, and demonstrated to
    Mozilla that they have all the appropriate audits, CP/CPS documents and other
    systems in place.</p>
  <p>The transferor MUST notify Mozilla about any necessary changes to EV status or
    trust bits in Mozilla's root store. If the transferee is receiving the (right
    to use the) associated EV policy OID(s), the transferor MUST confirm that the
    transferee has or will get the relevant audits before issuing EV certificates.</p>
  <h3 id="change-in-secure-location">8.3 Change in Secure Location</h3>
  <p>The section applies when section 8.1 and/or section 8.2 applies, and when the
    cryptographic hardware related to a certificate in Mozilla's root store is
    consequently moved from one secure location to another.</p>
  <p>This policy and the relevant WebTrust or ETSI requirements apply at all times,
    even during the physical relocation of a CA's online operations to a new data
    center and moving parts of an offline root certificate from one location to
    another. As such, a CA MUST always ensure that physical access to CA equipment
    is limited to authorized individuals, the equipment is operated under multiple
    person control, and unauthorized CA system usage is able to be detected at all
    times. The auditor MUST confirm that there are appropriate procedures in place
    to ensure that the requirements are met and that those procedures are followed.</p>
  <p>The following steps MUST be taken by the organization(s) concerned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the annual audit statements are current.</li>
    <li>Notify Mozilla of the pending change.</li>
    <li>Create a transfer plan (and legal agreement if more than one organization is
      involved) and have it reviewed by the auditors.</li>
    <li>Stop new certificate issuance at the current site before the transfer begins.</li>
    <li>Have an audit performed at the current site to confirm when the root
      certificate is ready for transfer, and to make sure the key material is
      properly secured.</li>
    <li>The transfer ceremony should be witnessed by auditors and video recorded,
      with a physical exchange of the HSM or ciphertext containing the associated key
      material and certificates, and the multi-party authorization keys.</li>
    <li>At the new site perform an audit to confirm that the transfer was successful,
      that the private key remained secure throughout the transfer, and that the root
      certificate is ready to resume issuance. This requirement may be met by
      including the transferred root certificate and key in the new owner's regular
      audits or by getting a PITRA.</li>
    <li>Send links to the updated CP/CPS and the updated audit statements, opinion
      letter, or PITRA statement to Mozilla.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The regular annual audit statements MUST still happen in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>The organization(s) concerned MUST immediately <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Mis-Issuance&amp;groups=crypto-core-security">send a security report to
    Mozilla</a> if a problem occurs.</p>
