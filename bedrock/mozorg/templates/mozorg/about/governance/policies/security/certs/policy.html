<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla includes with such software
a set of X.509v3 root certificates from various Certification
Authority (CA) operators. As used herein, a CA operator is an organization or legal entity that is in possession or control of a CA certificate and its associated keys, which are capable of being used to issue new certificates. The included CA certificates have their "trust bits"
set for various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
certificates to anchor a chain of trust for certificates used by TLS servers
and S/MIME email users without having to ask users for further permission or
information.</p>
<p>This policy covers how the default set of certificates and associated trust
bits is maintained for software products distributed by Mozilla. Other entities
distributing software based on ours are free to adopt their own policies. In
particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s), distributors of
such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates and modify the
values of the trust bits in the versions that they distribute. However,
as with other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may
well affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
versions of the software. See the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy/">Mozilla trademark policy</a> for more
information.</p>
<h3 id="11-scope">1.1 Scope</h3>
<p>This policy applies to CA operators and the certificates they issue or control that match any of the following:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>
<p>CA certificates included in, or under consideration for inclusion in, the
Mozilla root store;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intermediate certificates that have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
to such a CA certificate and that are technically capable of issuing
working server or email certificates. Intermediate certificates that are not considered to be technically capable will contain either:</p>
<ul>
<li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension that does not contain any of
these KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
id-kp-emailProtection; or</li>
<li>name constraints that do not allow Subject Alternative Names (SANs) of
any of the following types: dNSName, iPAddress, SRVName, or rfc822Name; <em>and</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>end entity certificates that have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
to such a CA certificate through intermediate certificates that are all in
scope and</p>
<ul>
<li>an EKU extension that contains the anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId, or no EKU extension;</li>
<li>an EKU extension that contains the id-kp-serverAuth KeyPurposeId; or</li>
<li>an EKU extension that contains the id-kp-emailProtection KeyPurposeId and an rfc822Name or an otherName of type id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox in the subjectAltName.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
<h3 id="12-policy-ownership">1.2 Policy Ownership</h3>
<p>Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#CA_Certificates">CA Certificate module owner</a>
and peers to evaluate new CA requests on our behalf and to make decisions
regarding all matters relating to CA certificates included in our root store.</p>
<p>Further, Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Mozilla_CA_Certificate_Policy">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy module
owner</a> and peers to maintain this policy. The policy will
only be changed after public consultation with the Mozilla community, in order
to ensure that all views are taken into account. This policy MAY be updated periodically in accordance with the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Updating_Root_Store_Policy">Process for Updating the Root Store Policy</a>. CA operators MUST adhere to the current version of this policy. You can contact the Mozilla CA
Certificate Policy module team at <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> if you
have questions about this policy.</p>
<p>CA operators or others objecting to a particular decision by either team MAY appeal to
the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox_Technical_Leadership">Firefox Technical Leadership Module Committee</a> who will make a final
decision.</p>
<h2 id="2-certificate-authorities">2. Certificate Authorities</h2>
<h3 id="21-ca-operations">2.1 CA Operations</h3>
<p>CA operators whose certificates are included in Mozilla's root store MUST:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>provide some service relevant to users of our software
products;</li>
<li>follow industry best practice for securing their networks, for example
by conforming to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/netsec/documents/">CA/Browser Forum's Network and Certificate System Security Requirements</a> or a
successor document;</li>
<li>enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of causing
certificate issuance or performing Registration Authority or Delegated
Third Party functions, or implement technical controls operated by the CA
to restrict certificate issuance through the account to a limited set of
pre-approved domains or email addresses;</li>
<li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate
requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>
<li>verify each dNSName or IPAddress in a SAN or commonName in server certificates in accordance with sections 3.2.2.4 and 3.2.2.5 of the CA/Browser Forum's <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS Baseline Requirements</a> ("TLS BRs") at intervals of 398 days or less, and verify that all other information that is included in server certificates remains current and correct at intervals of 825 days or less;</li>
<li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
deem acceptable; <em>and</em></li>
<li>ensure that all certificates within the scope of this policy,
as described in Section 1.1, adhere to this policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>CA operators MUST follow and be aware of discussions in both the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy">Mozilla dev-security-policy</a> forum and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/ccadb.org/g/public">CCADB Public List</a>, where root store policies and program updates are announced and public discussions of root inclusion requests occur. They are encouraged, but not required, to contribute to those
discussions.</p>
<h3 id="22-validation-practices">2.2 Validation Practices</h3>
<p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be acceptable if it
meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>all information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
MUST be verified by using an independent source of information
or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
the certificate;</li>
<li>for a certificate capable of being used for digitally signing or encrypting
email messages, the CA operator MUST take reasonable measures to verify that
the entity submitting the request controls the email account
associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
<em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
the account holder’s behalf. This MUST be done using one or more of the methods documented in section 3.2.2 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/smime/documents/">CA/Browser Forum's S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a> ("S/MIME BRs"). The CA operator's CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the procedure(s)
that the CA employs to perform this verification;</li>
<li>for a certificate capable of being used for TLS-enabled servers, the CA
MUST ensure that the applicant has registered all domain(s) referenced
in the certificate or has been authorized by the domain registrant to
act on their behalf. This MUST be done using one or more of the
methods documented in section 3.2.2.4 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS BRs</a>. The CA operator's
CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
each documented procedure MUST state which subsection of 3.2.2.4 it is
complying with;</li>
<li>for a certificate capable of being used for TLS-enabled servers, the CA
MUST ensure that the applicant has control over all IP Address(es) referenced
in the certificate. This MUST be done using one or more of the
methods documented in section 3.2.2.5 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS BRs</a>. The CA operator's
CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
each documented procedure SHOULD state which subsection of 3.2.2.5 it is
complying with; <em>and</em></li>
<li>for certificates marked as Extended Validation, CA operators MUST comply with the
latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/documents/">Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of
Extended Validation Certificates</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Validation methods are occasionally found to contain security flaws. When this happens,
Mozilla expects CA operators to evaluate their practices and respond appropriately to mitigate the risk.
Mozilla MAY require CAs to make disclosures or modifications, up to and including
immediately discontinuing use of a method.</p>
<h3 id="23-baseline-requirements-conformance">2.3 Baseline Requirements Conformance</h3>
<p>CA operations relating to issuance of certificates capable of being used for
TLS-enabled servers MUST conform to the latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">CA/Browser
Forum's TLS BRs</a>. Certificates issued on or after September 1, 2023, that are capable of being used to digitally sign or encrypt email messages, and CA operations relating to the issuance of such certificates, MUST conform to the latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/smime/documents/">S/MIME BRs</a>. In the event of inconsistency
between this policy's requirements and either the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs,
this policy's requirements take precedence. The following is a list of known
places where this policy takes precedence over the S/MIME BRs and TLS BRs. If
you find an inconsistency that is not listed here, notify Mozilla so the item
can be considered for addition or clarification.</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>
<p>Insofar as the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs attempt to define their own scope, the
scope of this policy (section 1.1) overrides that. CA
operations relating to issuance of <strong>all</strong> S/MIME or TLS server certificates in the scope of
this policy SHALL conform to the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs, as applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mozilla MAY accept audits by auditors who do not meet the
qualifications given in section 8.2 of the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs, or refuse
audits from auditors who do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mozilla MAY restrict permitted algorithms to a subset of those allowed by the S/MIME BRs or TLS
BRs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="24-incidents">2.4 Incidents</h3>
<p>When a CA operator fails to comply with any requirement of this policy - whether it be a misissuance, a procedural or operational issue, or any other variety of
non-compliance - the event is classified as an <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident">incident</a>. CA operators MUST adhere to the <a href="https://www.ccadb.org/cas/incident-report">CCADB's Incident Reporting Guidelines</a> (IRGs). CA operators MUST update Incident Reports and respond to questions or comments in accordance with the IRGs until the corresponding <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a> bug is closed.</p>
<p>Mozilla expects the timely remediation of the problems that caused or gave rise to an incident. In response to incidents, Mozilla MAY further require that the CA operator submit a plan of action with milestones or submit one or more additional audits to provide sufficient assurance that the incident has been remediated. Such audits MAY be expected sooner than the CA operator’s next scheduled audit, and thus MAY be expected to be for a period less than a year.</p>
<h4 id="241-vulnerability-and-security-incident-reporting">2.4.1 Vulnerability and Security Incident Reporting</h4>
<p>Additionally, and not in lieu of the requirement to publicly report incidents as outlined above, a CA Operator MUST disclose a serious vulnerability or security incident in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a> as a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?bug_type=task&amp;component=CA%20Security%20Vulnerability&amp;groups=ca-program-security&amp;product=CA%20Program">secure bug</a> in accordance with guidance found on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Vulnerability_Disclosure">Vulnerability Disclosure wiki page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="3-documentation">3. Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="31-audits">3.1 Audits</h3>
<p>Before being included and at least annually thereafter, CA operators MUST obtain certain
audits for their root certificates and all intermediate certificates
that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates.
This section describes the requirements for those audits.</p>
<h4 id="311-audit-criteria">3.1.1 Audit Criteria</h4>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="313-audit-parameters">3.1.3 Audit Parameters</h4>
<p>Full-surveillance period-of-time audits MUST be conducted and updated audit
information provided no less frequently than <strong>annually</strong> from the time of CA key pair generation until the CA public key is no longer trusted by Mozilla's root store. For annual audit periods beginning on or after March 15, 2025, CA private keys that have been generated but not yet associated with a CA certificate ("parked keys") MUST be identified by the SHA-256 hashes of the CA Public Keys. Specifically, the SHA-256 hash MUST be calculated over the DER encoding of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo containing the CA Public Key and included in auditor-provided annual key lifecycle management reports (or a corresponding section or appendix of the CA operator's annual audit reports). These reports must account for the controls and measures applied to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and protection of these keys throughout their lifecycle, consistent with the audit criteria cited above. These cradle-to-grave audit requirements apply equally to intermediate CAs as they do to root CAs. Successive period-of-time audits and auditor-provided annual key lifecycle management reports MUST be contiguous (no gaps).</p>
<p>Point-in-time audit statements MAY be used to confirm that all problems
that an auditor previously identified in a qualified audit statement have been
corrected. However, a point-in-time audit does not replace the
period-of-time audit.</p>
<p>Audit reports that are being supplied to maintain a certificate within the
Mozilla root store MUST be provided to Mozilla via the CCADB within three
months of the point-in-time date or the end date of the period of time.</p>
<h4 id="314-public-audit-information">3.1.4 Public Audit Information</h4>
<p>The publicly-available documentation relating to each audit MUST contain the information required by section 5.1 of the <a href="https://www.ccadb.org/policy">CCADB Policy</a> (v.1.3.1) and the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Audit_Statements#Audited_Locations">CA locations that were or were not audited</a>. Audit reports MUST also contain or be accompanied by the name of the lead auditor and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Audit_Statements#Auditor_Qualifications">qualifications of the team</a> performing the audit, as required by section 3.2.</p>
<p>If Mozilla determines that an audit provided does not meet the requirements of this policy, then Mozilla MAY require that the CA operator obtain a new audit, at the CA operator's expense, for the period of time in question. Additionally, depending on the nature of concerns with the audit, Mozilla MAY require that the CA operator obtain such an audit from a new auditor.</p>
<h3 id="32-auditors">3.2 Auditors</h3>
<p>In normal circumstances, Mozilla requires that audits MUST be performed
by a Qualified Auditor, as defined in section 8.2 of the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs.</p>
<p>A Qualified Auditor MUST have relevant IT Security experience, or have audited a number of CAs, and be independent. ETSI Audit Attestation Letters MUST follow the Audit Attestation Letter template on the <a href="https://www.acab-c.com/downloads">ACAB'c website</a>, and ETSI auditors MUST be members of the <a href="https://www.acab-c.com/members/">Accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies' Council</a> and follow the ACAB'c Charter and Code of Conduct. WebTrust audit statements MUST follow the practitioner guidance, principles, and illustrative assurance reports on the <a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/audit-and-assurance/overview-of-webtrust-services/principles-and-criteria">CPA Canada website</a>, and WebTrust auditors MUST be listed as <a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/audit-and-assurance/overview-of-webtrust-services/licensed-webtrust-practitioners-international">enrolled WebTrust practitioners</a> on the CPA Canada website. Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, decide to temporarily waive membership or enrollment requirements.</p>
<p>Each Audit Report MUST be accompanied by documentation provided to Mozilla of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Audit_Statements#Auditor_Qualifications">audit team qualifications</a> sufficient for Mozilla to determine the competence, experience, and independence of the auditor.</p>
<p>If a CA operator wishes to use auditors who do not fit the definition of Qualified Auditor, then it MUST
receive written permission from Mozilla to do so in advance of the start
of the audit engagement. Mozilla will make its own determination as to
the suitability of the suggested party or parties, at its sole discretion.</p>
<h3 id="33-cps-and-cpses">3.3 CPs and CPSes</h3>
<p>We rely on publicly disclosed documentation (e.g., in a Certificate Policy and
Certification Practice Statement) to ascertain that our requirements are met.
Therefore:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>
<p>the publicly disclosed documentation MUST provide sufficient
information for Mozilla to determine whether and how the CA operator
complies with this policy, including a description of the steps
taken by the CA to verify certificate requests;</p>

<p>CA operations MUST at all times be in accordance with the applicable CP
and CPS (or combined CP/CPS).</p>
<p>CA operators MUST maintain a certificate hierarchy such that an included
root certificate does not directly issue end entity certificates to
customers (i.e. a root certificate signs intermediate
issuing certificates), as described in section 6.1.7 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS
BRs</a> and the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/smime/documents/">S/MIME BRs</a>.</p>
<p>CA operators MUST maintain current best practices to prevent
algorithm attacks against certificates. As such, all new certificates
MUST have a serial number greater than zero, containing at least 64 bits of
output from a CSPRNG.</p>
<p>CA operators MUST NOT issue certificates, CRLs, or OCSP responses, that have:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>ASN.1 DER encoding errors;</li>
<li>invalid public keys (e.g., RSA certificates with public exponent
equal to 1); <em>or</em></li>
<li>missing or incorrect extensions (e.g., TLS certificates with no subjectAltName extension, delegated OCSP responders without the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension, partial/scoped CRLs that lack a distributionPoint in a critical issuingDistributionPoint extension).</li>
</ul>
<p>CA operators MUST NOT issue certificates that have:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>duplicate issuer names and serial numbers (except that a Certificate
Transparency pre-certificate is allowed to match the corresponding
certificate); <em>or</em></li>
<li>cRLDistributionPoints or OCSP authorityInfoAccess extensions for
which no operational CRL or OCSP service exists.</li>
</ul>
<p>CA operators MUST NOT generate the key pairs for end entity certificates that have an
EKU extension containing the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-serverAuth or anyExtendedKeyUsage, unless the certificate is being issued to the CA itself.</p>
<p>All end entity certificates MUST include an EKU extension containing KeyPurposeId(s)
describing the intended usage(s) of the certificate, and the EKU extension MUST NOT
contain the KeyPurposeId anyExtendedKeyUsage.</p>
<h3 id="53-intermediate-certificates">5.3 Intermediate Certificates</h3>
<p>All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates and that directly or transitively chain to a CA certificate included in Mozilla’s root store MUST be operated in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p>A certificate is deemed capable of being used to issue new
certificates if it contains an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-6.1.4">X.509v3 basicConstraints extension</a>
with the cA boolean set to true.</p>

(2)	the certificate is signed with a Private Key whose corresponding Public Key is encoded in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo of that CA certificate or intermediate certificate.</p>
<p>Intermediate certificates created after January 1, 2019, with the exception of cross-certificates that share a private key with a corresponding root certificate:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

<li>MUST NOT include the anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId; <em>and</em></li>

</ul>
<h4 id="531-technically-constrained">5.3.1 Technically Constrained</h4>
<p>We encourage CA operators to technically constrain all intermediate

constrained, the certificate MUST include an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12">Extended Key Usage
(EKU)</a> extension specifying the extended key usage(s) allowed for the type of end entity certificates that the
intermediate CA is authorized to issue. We also encourage CA operators to include only a single KeyPurposeID in the EKU extension of intermediate certificates. The anyExtendedKeyUsage
KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension.</p>
<p>The conformance requirements defined in section 2.3 of this policy also apply to
technically constrained intermediate certificates.</p>
<p>If the intermediate CA certificate includes the id-kp-serverAuth extended key usage,
then to be considered technically constrained, the certificate MUST be name-constrained as described in section
7.1.2.5 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS BRs</a>, each entry in permittedSubtrees having been validated according to section
3.2.2 of the TLS BRs. The id-kp-clientAuth EKU MAY also be present.</p>
<p>If the intermediate CA certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended key
usage, then to be considered technically
constrained, it MUST comply with section 7.1.5 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/smime/documents/">S/MIME BRs</a> and include the Name Constraints X.509v3 extension with
constraints on rfc822Name, with at least one name in permittedSubtrees,
each name having been validated according to section
3.2.2 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/smime/documents/">S/MIME BRs</a>. The values id-kp-serverAuth and anyExtendedKeyUsage MUST NOT be present. The id-kp-clientAuth EKU MAY be present. Other values that the CA is allowed to use and are documented in the CA’s CP, CPS, or combined CP/CPS MAY be present.</p>
<h4 id="532-publicly-disclosed-and-audited">5.3.2 Publicly Disclosed and Audited</h4>
<p>The operator of a CA certificate included in Mozilla’s root store MUST publicly disclose in the CCADB all CA certificates it issues that chain up to that CA certificate trusted in Mozilla’s root store that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates, including such CA certificates that are revoked but not yet expired and those CA certificates that share the same key pair whether they are self-signed, doppelgänger, reissued, cross-signed, or other roots. The CA operator with a certificate included in Mozilla’s root store MUST disclose such CA certificate in the CCADB within one week of certificate creation, and before any such CA is allowed to issue certificates. Name-constrained CA certificates that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates that were exempt from disclosure in previous versions of this policy MUST also be disclosed in the CCADB, but the submission of an audit report under section 3.1 of this policy is not required.</p>
<p>All disclosure MUST be made freely available and without additional requirements, including, but not limited to, registration, legal agreements, or restrictions on redistribution of the certificates in whole or in part.</p>
<p>We recognize that technically constraining intermediate
certificates as described above may not be practical in some cases.
All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
certificates, that are not technically constrained, and that
directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in
Mozilla’s root store MUST be audited in accordance with this policy, and the corresponding audit statements MUST be disclosed in the CCADB according to <a href="https://www.ccadb.org/policy#5-policies-audits-and-practices">section 5 of the CCADB Policy</a>.
If the CA operator has a currently valid audit report at the time of creation
of the intermediate certificate, then the new intermediate certificate MUST appear on the
CA operator's next periodic audit reports.</p>
<h3 id="54-precertificates">5.4 Precertificates</h3>
<p>The logging of a precertificate in a Certificate Transparency log is considered by Mozilla to be a binding intent to issue a final certificate, as described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6962#section-3.1">section 3.1 of RFC 6962</a>. "Final certificate" means a certificate that is not a precertificate. Precertificates are in-scope for enforcing compliance with these requirements. A final certificate is "based on" a precertificate if they have the same serial and issuer, or they have the same serial and the final certificate's issuer matches the precertificate's issuer's issuer. Thus,</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>it is mississuance to issue a final certificate based on a precertificate if they do not exactly match each other according to RFC 6962, section 3.1;</li>
<li>if a precertificate implies the existence of a final certificate that does not comply with this policy, it is considered misissuance of the final certificate, even if the certificate does not actually exist;</li>
<li>a CA MUST be able to revoke a certificate presumed to exist, if revocation of the certificate is required under this policy, even if the final certificate does not actually exist; <em>and</em></li>
<li>a CA MUST provide CRL and OCSP services and responses in accordance with this policy for all certificates presumed to exist based on the presence of a precertificate, even if the certificate does not actually exist.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-revocation">6. Revocation</h2>
<p>CA operators MUST maintain an online 24x7 repository mechanism whereby
application software can automatically check online the current
status of all unexpired certificates issued by the CA.</p>
<p>For end entity certificates, CRLs MUST be updated and reissued at least
every seven days, and the value of the nextUpdate field MUST NOT be
more than ten days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.</p>
<p>For end entity certificates, if the CA provides revocation information
via an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>it MUST update that service at least every four days;</li>
<li>responses MUST have a defined value in the nextUpdate field, and it

notAfter date of all certificates included within the
BasicOCSPResponse.certs field or, if the certs field is omitted,
before or equal to the notAfter date of the CA certificate which
issued the certificate that the BasicOCSPResponse is for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section 4.9.12 of a CA operator's CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the methods that parties may use to demonstrate private key compromise.</p>

TLS-enabled servers, CAs MUST revoke certificates that they have
issued upon the occurrence of any event listed in the appropriate
subsection of section 4.9.1 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS BRs</a>,
according to the timeline defined therein. CAs MUST also revoke
any certificates issued in violation of the then-current version
of this policy according to the timeline defined in
section 4.9.1 of the TLS BRs.</p>
<h4 id="611-end-entity-tls-certificate-crlrevocation-reasons">6.1.1 End Entity TLS Certificate CRLRevocation Reasons</h4>
<p>When an end entity TLS certificate (i.e. a certificate capable of being used for TLS-enabled servers) is revoked for one of the reasons below, the specified CRLReason MUST be included in the reasonCode extension of the CRL entry corresponding to the end entity TLS certificate, as described in sections 4.9.1 and 7.2.2 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/documents/">TLS BRs</a>.</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>keyCompromise (RFC 5280 CRLReason #1);</li>
<li>privilegeWithdrawn (RFC 5280 CRLReason #9);</li>
<li>cessationOfOperation (RFC 5280 CRLReason #5);</li>
<li>affiliationChanged (RFC 5280 CRLReason #3); <em>or</em></li>
<li>superseded (RFC 5280 CRLReason #4).</li>
</ul>
<p>The keyCompromise,  superseded, and privilegeWithdrawn CRLReasons MUST only be used for the situations listed in the TLS BRs as corresponding to these revocation reasons. Otherwise, the keyCompromise, superseded, and privilegeWithdrawn CRLReasons MUST NOT be used.</p>
<p>Mozilla’s wiki page, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Reasons">"Revocation Reasons"</a>, provides further details about when the CRLReasons listed above must and must not be used.</p>
<h4 id="612-tls-certificate-crl-issuing-distribution-points">6.1.2 TLS Certificate CRL Issuing Distribution Points</h4>
<p>A CRL whose scope does not include all unexpired certificates that are issued by the CA SHALL contain a critical Issuing Distribution Point extension (OID 2.5.29.28). The distributionPoint field of the extension SHALL include a UniformResourceIdentifier whose value is derived from one of the two following sources:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>The UniformResourceIdentifier as encoded in the distributionPoint field of an issued certificate's CRL Distribution Points extension (see RFC 5280 section 5.2.5); or</li>
<li>The URL as included in the "JSON Array of Partitioned CRLs" field in the CCADB entry corresponding to the certificate for the issuing CA.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="613-delayed-revocation">6.1.3 Delayed Revocation</h4>
<p>Mozilla’s goal is to ensure that revocation occurs as swiftly as possible while maintaining the overall security and stability of the web.
Mozilla does not grant exceptions to the revocation requirements of the TLS BRs.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning September 1, 2025, each CA operator MUST:</strong></p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>engage in proactive communication and advise subscribers well in advance about the revocation timelines and explicitly warn them against using publicly-trusted TLS server certificates on systems that cannot tolerate timely revocation;</li>
<li>include appropriate language in customer agreements requiring subscribers’ timely cooperation in meeting revocation timelines and acknowledging the CA’s obligations to adhere to applicable policies and standards; and</li>
<li>prepare and maintain comprehensive and actionable plans to address mass revocation events, including detailed procedures for handling mass revocations effectively, including rapid communication with affected parties and conducting annual plan testing through tabletop exercises, simulations, parallel testing, or use of test environments, which do not involve the revocation of active certificates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment Requirement</strong></p>
<p>Beginning with the CA operator’s next annual audit cycle starting on or after June 1, 2025, each CA operator MUST engage a third-party assessor to evaluate whether the CA operator has:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>well-documented and actionable plans to handle mass revocation events;</li>
<li>demonstrated the implementation and feasibility of the plans through testing exercises, including documentation of testing processes, timelines, results, and remediation steps; and</li>
<li>incorporated feedback from such testing exercises and other evaluations to enhance readiness and improve future performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above-referenced June 1, 2025, date is to ensure that compliance with the September 1, 2025, requirements will be evaluated within a reasonable timeframe while allowing CA operators to incorporate mass revocation testing into their CA processes and annual audit cycles. However, the assessment does not have to be conducted as part of the CA operator’s ETSI or WebTrust audit unless the CA operator finds it more convenient to include it within that scope. The assessment may be conducted separately by a qualified third-party assessor, provided it meets the stated evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ccadb.org/cas/incident-report">CCADB's Incident Reporting Guidelines</a> have reporting requirements that MUST be followed by CA operators who determine they might delay revocation of certificates beyond the time period required by the TLS BRs. For instance, the Analysis field in the Impact section of such incident reports MUST explain "the factors and rationales behind the decision to delay revocation (including detailed and substantiated explanations of how extensive harm would result to third parties–such as essential public services or widely relied-upon systems–and why the situation is exceptionally rare and unavoidable)." All delayed revocation incidents MUST be listed as findings in the CA operator’s next TLS BR audit statement. Repeated incidents of delayed revocation without sufficient justification will result in heightened scrutiny and sanctions, which may include removal of the CA from the Mozilla Root Store.</p>
<h3 id="62-smime">6.2 S/MIME</h3>
<p>For any certificate in a hierarchy capable of being used for S/MIME, CAs MUST revoke certificates that they have issued upon the occurrence of any event listed in the appropriate subsection of section 4.9.1 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/smime/documents/">S/MIME BRs</a>, according to the timeline defined therein. CAs MUST also revoke any certificates issued in violation of the then-current version of this policy according to the timeline defined in section 4.9.1 of the S/MIME BRs.</p>
<h2 id="7-root-store-changes">7. Root Store Changes</h2>
<p>Changes that are motivated by a security concern, such as a root or intermediate CA compromise, MUST be treated as
security-sensitive, and a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Vulnerability_Disclosure">Vulnerability Disclosure</a> MUST be filed as a secure bug in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?bug_type=task&amp;component=CA%20Security%20Vulnerability&amp;groups=ca-program-security&amp;product=CA%20Program">Bugzilla</a>.</p>
<h3 id="71-inclusions">7.1 Inclusions</h3>
<p>We will determine which CA certificates are included in Mozilla's root store
based on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_Inclusion_Considerations">risks of such inclusion to typical users of our products</a>. We will consider adding
additional CA certificates to the default certificate set upon request only by
an authorized representative of the subject CA. We will make such decisions
through a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">public process</a>.</p>
<p>We will not charge any fees to have a CA operator’s certificate(s)
included in Mozilla's root store.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to not include certificates from a particular CA operator in
our root store. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
where we believe that a CA operator has caused undue risks to users’
security, e.g. by knowingly issuing certificates without the knowledge of the
entities whose information is referenced in those certificates ('MITM certificates').
Mozilla is under no obligation to explain the reasoning behind any inclusion decision.</p>
<p>Before being included, CA operators MUST provide evidence that their CA key pairs and CA certificates fully comply with the current Mozilla Root Store Requirements and the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs, and have continually, from the time of CA private key creation (see section 3.1.3), complied with the then-current Mozilla Root Store Policy and the S/MIME BRs or TLS BRs, as applicable.</p>
<p>Additionally, CA operators applying for inclusion of new root certificates with the websites trust bit enabled MUST demonstrate support for at least one automated method of certificate issuance for each type of TLS certificate (EV, OV, DV, IV) intended to be issued under the root certificate being requested for inclusion. This means (1) automated domain control validation, as defined in the TLS BRs; and (2) automated certificate issuance and retrieval processes. Such automated methods MUST minimize hands-on human input during routine certificate issuance and renewal processes and comply with the TLS BRs, and EV Guidelines, if applicable. Acceptable "hands-on" input includes initial software setup, configuration, updates, and identity verification where required. CA operators MUST renew test certificates using such capability at least every 30 days to demonstrate compliance with these automation requirements. The test certificates MUST be served by publicly accessible websites, and the URL for each test site MUST be disclosed in the CCADB.</p>
<p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to Mozilla's root store, a CA operator
SHOULD submit a formal request by submitting a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?bug_type=task&amp;product=CA%20Program&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Root%20Program">bug report</a>
into <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>, filed against the "CA
Certificate Root Program" component of the "CA Program" product. Mozilla’s wiki
page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>", provides
further details about how to submit a formal request. The request
MUST be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA operator, and
MUST include the following:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>
<li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
within the certificate hierarchy associated with the CA
certificate:
<ul>
<li>TLS-enabled servers</li>
<li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
issues Extended Validation certificates within the certificate hierarchy
associated with the CA certificate and, if so, the CA/Browser Forum EV policy
OID of 2.23.140.1.1 associated with the CA certificate;</li>
<li>links to the CP and CPS (or combined CP/CPS) for the CA or CAs in question;</li>
<li>an auditor-witnessed root key generation ceremony report and contiguous
period-of-time audit reports performed thereafter no less frequently than
annually;</li>
<li>evidence of automated certificate issuance support, as specified above (if seeking enablement of the websites trust bit);
<em>and</em></li>
<li>information as to how the CA operator has fulfilled the requirements
stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will reject requests where the CA operator does not provide such
information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
request.</p>
<h3 id="72-updates">7.2 Updates</h3>
<p>Changes MAY be made to CA certificates that are included in
Mozilla's root store as follows:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>enabling a trust bit in a CA certificate that is currently
included, MAY only be done after careful consideration of the
CA operator’s current policies, practices, and audits,
and MAY be requested by a representative of the CA or a

page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
<li>enabling EV in a CA certificate that is currently included,
MAY only be done after careful consideration of the CA operator’s current
policies, practices, and audits,
and MAY be requested by a representative of the CA operator or a
representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
<li>disabling a CA certificate is the act of turning off one or more of the
trust bits (websites or email), and MAY be
requested by a representative of the CA operator or a representative of
Mozilla by submitting a bug report into <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Certificate_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>; <em>and</em></li>
<li>a representative of the CA operator or a representative of Mozilla MAY
request that a CA certificate be removed by submitting a bug
report into <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a>, as described in the
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Certificate_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="73-removals">7.3 Removals</h3>
<p>Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, decide to disable (partially or fully), or
remove a certificate, at any time and for any reason. This MAY happen
immediately or on a planned future date. Mozilla will
disable or remove a certificate if the CA operator demonstrates ongoing or
egregious practices that do not maintain the expected level of service
or that do not comply with the requirements of this policy.</p>
<p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
if we learn that a CA operator has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
or more certificates. This MAY include, but is not limited to,
disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all the CA operator’s
certificates from Mozilla’s root store.</p>
<p>The category of mis-issued certificates includes (but is not limited to) those
issued to someone who should not have received them, those containing
information which was not properly validated, those having incorrect technical
constraints, and those using algorithms other than those permitted.</p>
<p>A failure to provide notifications or updates in the CCADB or
as otherwise required in a timely manner SHALL also be grounds for
disabling a CA operator’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla's root
store. For this policy and the CCADB policies, "a timely manner" means
within 30 days of when the appropriate data or documentation becomes
available to the CA operator, unless a Mozilla policy document specifies a different
rule.</p>
<p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA operator’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
root store based on a CA operator’s actions (or failure to act) that are
contrary to this policy, Mozilla will publicize
that fact (for example, on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy">Mozilla dev-security-policy list</a>, and on our websites) and MAY also alert
relevant news, government, or industry organizations.</p>
<h3 id="74-root-ca-lifecycles">7.4 Root CA Lifecycles</h3>
<p>For a root CA certificate trusted for server authentication, Mozilla will remove the websites trust bit when the CA key material is more than 15 years from the CA key material generation date. For a root CA certificate trusted for secure email, Mozilla will set the "Distrust for S/MIME After Date" for the CA certificate to 18 years from the CA key material generation date. The CA key material generation date SHALL be determined by reference to the auditor-witnessed key generation ceremony report. If the CA operator cannot provide the key generation ceremony report for a root CA certificate created before July 1, 2012, then Mozilla will use the “Valid From” date in the root CA certificate to establish the key material generation date. For transition purposes, root CA certificates in the Mozilla root store will be distrusted according to the schedule located at https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles, which is subject to change if underlying algorithms become more susceptible to cryptanalytic attack or if other circumstances arise that make this schedule obsolete.</p>
<p>CA operators are strongly urged to apply to Mozilla for inclusion of their next generation root certificate at least 2 years before the distrust date of the CA certificate they wish to replace.</p>
<h3 id="75-dedicated-root-certificates">7.5 Dedicated Root Certificates</h3>
<p>All root CA certificates added to Mozilla's Root Store after March 15, 2025, will only be trusted for either TLS server authentication (websites trust bit) or S/MIME email protection (email trust bit). Existing root CA certificates that do not comply with this requirement MUST transition to one or the other prior to December 31, 2028, i.e., by having one of their trust bits (websites or email) removed.</p>
<p>CA operators with root certificates that have both the websites and email trust bits enabled SHOULD review the transition schedule associated with Section 7.4 (Root CA Lifecycles) when planning their compliance with this section 7.5. Specifically, CA operators SHOULD be aware that Mozilla’s trust bit transition schedule will result in the removal of the websites trust bit from certain root certificates before December 31, 2028.</p>
<h4 id="751-server-authentication-hierarchies">7.5.1 Server Authentication Hierarchies</h4>
<p>Subordinate CA and end entity certificates issued under a Root CA certificate added after March 15, 2025, with the websites trust bit enabled MUST include an extendedKeyUsage extension that asserts only id-kp-serverAuth or both id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth. OCSP signing certificates are exempt from this EKU restriction and MUST only include the id-kp-OCSPSigning EKU.</p>
<h4 id="752-smime-hierarchies">7.5.2 S/MIME Hierarchies</h4>
<p>Subordinate CA and end entity certificates issued under a Root CA certificate added after March 15, 2025, with the email trust bit enabled MUST include an extendedKeyUsage extension that asserts id-kp-emailProtection. They MAY include other extendedKeyUsages, but they MUST NOT include extendedKeyUsages of id-kp-serverAuth, id-kp-codeSigning, id-kp-timeStamping, or anyExtendedKeyUsage. OCSP signing certificates are exempt from this EKU restriction and MUST only include the id-kp-OCSPSigning EKU.</p>
<h4 id="753-transition-plan-for-existing-roots">7.5.3 Transition Plan for Existing Roots</h4>
<p>Root CA certificates included in Mozilla's Root Store as of January 1, 2025, that have both the websites and the email trust bits enabled MAY remain trusted after April 15, 2026, if the CA operator has submitted a transition plan by April 15, 2026, to migrate to dedicated hierarchies by December 31, 2028.</p>
<p>Transition plans MAY include:</p>
<ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>Submission of requests for inclusion of single-purpose roots;</li>
<li>Requests to remove the websites trust bit or the email trust bit from a dual-purpose root;</li>
<li>Timelines for phasing out conflicting uses of the root (e.g. dates by which inconsistent certificates will expire or issuance will cease); and</li>
<li>Revocation or replacement of certificates that do not meet the requirements of Sections 7.5.1 or 7.5.2.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="8-ca-operational-changes">8. CA Operational Changes</h2>
<p>CA operators SHALL NOT assume that trust is transferable. All CA operators whose certificates
are included in Mozilla's root store MUST <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">notify Mozilla</a> before:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>ownership or control of the CA’s certificate(s) changes;</li>
<li>an organization other than the CA operator obtains control of an unconstrained
intermediate certificate (as defined in section 5.3 of this policy) that
directly or transitively chains to a certificate included in Mozilla's root store - see <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a>;</li>
<li>ownership or control of the CA’s operations changes; <em>or</em></li>
<li>there is a change in the CA's operations that could affect the CA's ability to comply with the requirements of this Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>CA operators SHOULD err on the side of notification if there is any doubt. Mozilla will
normally keep commercially sensitive information confidential. Throughout any
change, CA operations MUST continue to meet the requirements of this policy. If
one of the above events occurs, Mozilla MAY require additional audit(s) as a
condition of remaining in the root store. CA operators are encouraged to notify Mozilla in
advance in order to avoid unfortunate surprises.</p>
<p>In addition, one or more of the following sections MAY apply.</p>
<h3 id="81-change-in-legal-ownership">8.1 Change in Legal Ownership</h3>
<p>This section applies when one company buys or takes a controlling stake in
a CA or CA operator, or when an organization obtains control of a CA key pair that is
within the scope of Mozilla's root store, unless it is constrained in
compliance with section 5.3.1 of this policy.</p>
<p>Mozilla MUST be notified of any resulting changes in the CA operator's CP, CPS, or combined CP/CPS.</p>
<p>If the receiving or acquiring company is new to the Mozilla root store,
it MUST demonstrate compliance with the entirety of this policy. There
MUST be a public discussion regarding its admittance to the root store.
If Mozilla reaches a positive conclusion after public discussion, then the affected certificate(s) MAY remain in the root store. If the entire
CA operation is not included in the scope of the transaction, issuance is not
permitted until the discussion has been resolved with a positive conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="82-change-in-operational-personnel">8.2 Change in Operational Personnel</h3>
<p>This section applies when operation of a CA certificate that is within the
scope of Mozilla's root store and not constrained in compliance with section
5.3.1 of this policy is transferred to a different organization,
whether by acquisition or contract.</p>
<p>The transferor MUST ensure that the transferee is able to fully comply with
this policy. The transferor will continue to be responsible for the root
certificate's private key until Mozilla has been provided with an audit
statement (or opinion letter) confirming successful transfer of the root
certificate and key. Issuance MUST NOT occur until the transferee
has provided all the information required by the CCADB, and demonstrated to
Mozilla that they have all the appropriate audits, CP/CPS documents, and other
systems in place.</p>
<p>The transferor MUST notify Mozilla about any necessary changes to EV status or
trust bits in Mozilla's root store. If the transferee will be technically capable of issuing EV certificates, the transferor MUST confirm that the
transferee has or will get the relevant audits before issuing EV certificates.</p>
<h3 id="83-change-in-secure-location">8.3 Change in Secure Location</h3>
<p>This section only applies when section 8.1 and/or section 8.2 applies, and when the
cryptographic hardware related to a CA certificate that is within the scope of
Mozilla's root store and not constrained in compliance with section
5.3.1 of this policy is consequently moved from one secure location to another.</p>
<p>This policy and the relevant WebTrust or ETSI requirements apply at all times,
even during the physical relocation of a CA's online operations to a new data
center and moving parts of an offline root certificate from one location to
another. As such, a CA operator MUST always ensure that physical access to CA equipment
is limited to authorized individuals, the equipment is operated under multi-person control, and unauthorized CA system usage is able to be detected at all
times. The auditor MUST confirm that there are appropriate procedures in place
to ensure that the requirements are met and that those procedures are followed.</p>
<p>The following steps MUST be taken by the organization(s) concerned:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>ensure that annual audit statements are current;</li>
<li>notify Mozilla of the pending change;</li>
<li>create a transfer plan (and legal agreement if more than one organization is
involved) and have it reviewed by the auditors;</li>
<li>stop new certificate issuance at the current site before the transfer begins;</li>
<li>have an audit performed at the current site to confirm when the root
certificate is ready for transfer, and ensure that key material is
properly secured;</li>
<li>have the transfer ceremony witnessed by auditors and video recorded,
with a physical exchange of the HSM or ciphertext containing the associated key
material and certificates, and the multi-party authorization keys;</li>
<li>perform an audit at the new site to confirm that the transfer was successful,
that the private key remained secure throughout the transfer, and that the root
certificate is ready to resume issuance. This requirement MAY be met by
including the transferred root certificate and key in the new owner's regular
audits or by getting a point-in-time audit; <em>and</em></li>
<li>send links to the updated CP, CPS, and the updated audit statements, opinion
letter, or point-in-time audit statement to Mozilla.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular annual audit statements MUST still happen in a timely manner.</p>
<p>If a security issue arises during key transfer, then the organization(s) concerned MUST immediately file a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Vulnerability_Disclosure">Vulnerability Disclosure</a> in Bugzilla using a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?bug_type=task&amp;component=CA%20Security%20Vulnerability&amp;groups=ca-program-security&amp;product=CA%20Program">secure bug</a>.</p>
<h3 id="84-externally-operated-subordinate-cas">8.4 Externally-Operated Subordinate CAs</h3>
<p>The operator of a root CA certificate that is included in Mozilla’s root store is at all times completely and ultimately accountable for every certificate signed under that root CA certificate, whether directly or through subordinate CAs or cross-certified CAs. The operator of the root CA certificate SHALL ensure that the operator of each subordinate or cross-certified CA fully and continually adheres to this policy.</p>
<p>The root CA operator MUST complete Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a> (including successful review and approval by Mozilla) before a new externally-operated subordinate CA begins issuing certificates under any of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>the subordinate CA operator will obtain a unconstrained (per section 5.3.1 of this policy) CA certificate, and the subordinate CA operator is not approved by Mozilla to issue the type of certificates (email, TLS, or EV TLS), which they will be able to issue under the new CA certificate;</li>
<li>the root CA operator is cross-signing a CA certificate of a CA operator who is not currently in Mozilla’s root store; <em>or</em></li>
<li>the root CA operator is cross-signing a CA certificate of another CA operator who is currently in Mozilla’s root store, but the other CA operator has not been approved for the same trust bits (email or websites) or EV, and those trust bits or EV will be recognized under the cross-signed certificate that it will be receiving.</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right to not approve subordinate CA certificates. This includes (but is not limited to) cases where we believe that approval of a subordinate CA operator would cause undue risks to users’ security. Mozilla is under no obligation to explain the reasoning behind such decisions.</p>
<p>When any of the following conditions apply, the root CA operator is not required to perform Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a> before the subordinate CA certificate begins issuing certificates:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
<li>the subordinate CA will be operated directly by the root CA operator under the exact same policies and practices of the root CA operator and within the same scope of audit reporting, and no new organizations will be involved in the management or operation of the CA;</li>
<li>the CA certificate is technically constrained as described in section 5.3.1 of this policy;</li>
<li>the subordinate CA operator:
<ul>
<li>has previously undergone the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a>;</li>
<li>has been approved for the type of certificates to be issued (email, TLS, or EV TLS); <em>and</em></li>
<li>will operate under the same policies and practices as the previous review, and under the same scope of audit reporting as the prior subordinate CA certificate. (Newer versions of policies and practices MAY be used, provided that the subordinate CA operator follows the same versions of the policies for both the existing and new CA certificates.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as of June 1, 2022, the subordinate CA operator was already trusted for issuing the same type of certificates under an existing subordinate CA certificate that directly or transitively chains to a certificate included in Mozilla’s root store; <em>or</em></li>
<li>the root CA operator is cross-signing a CA certificate of another CA operator that is currently in Mozilla’s root store, and that other CA operator:
<ul>
<li>will only be able to issue the same type of certificate (email, TLS, or EV TLS) that they are already approved for in Mozilla’s root store; <em>and</em></li>
<li>will operate both the cross-signed certificate and their CA certificate(s) under the same policies, practices, and scope of audit that their CA certificate was approved for. Newer versions of policies and practices MAY be used, provided that the cross-signed CA operator follows the same versions of the policies for both the cross-signed certificate and their CA certificate(s).</li>
