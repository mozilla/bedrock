  <p><em>Version 2.8</em></p>
  <p><em><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_Store_Policy_Archive">Effective June 1, 2022</a></em></p>
  <h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
  other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla includes with such software
  a set of X.509v3 root certificates from various Certification
  Authority (CA) operators. The included certificates have their "trust bits"
  set for various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
  certificates to anchor a chain of trust for certificates used by TLS servers
  and S/MIME email users without having to ask users for further permission or
  information.</p>
  <p>This policy covers how the default set of certificates and associated trust
  bits is maintained for software products distributed by Mozilla. Other entities
  distributing software based on ours are free to adopt their own policies. In
  particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of
  such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates and modify the
  values of the trust bits in the versions that they distribute. However,
  as with other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor may
  well affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
  versions of the software. See the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy/">Mozilla trademark policy</a> for more
  information.</p>
  <h3 id="11-scope">1.1 Scope</h3>
  <p>This policy applies, as appropriate, to certificates matching any of the
  following (and to the CA operators* that control or issue them):</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      <p>CA certificates included in, or under consideration for inclusion in, the
        Mozilla root store;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>intermediate certificates that have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate and that are technically capable of issuing
        working server or email certificates. Intermediate certificates that are not considered to be technically capable will contain either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension that does not contain any of
          these KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
          id-kp-emailProtection; or</li>
        <li>name constraints that do not allow Subject Alternative Names (SANs) of
          any of the following types: dNSName, iPAddress, SRVName, or rfc822Name; <em>and</em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>end entity certificates that have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate through intermediate certificates that are all in
        scope, such end entity certificates having either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension that contains one or more of these
          KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
          id-kp-emailProtection; or</li>
        <li>no EKU extension.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
  interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
  <p>* A CA operator is an organization or legal entity that is in possession or control of a CA certificate and associated keys, which are capable of being used to issue new certificates.</p>
  <h3 id="12-policy-ownership">1.2 Policy Ownership</h3>
  <p>Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#CA_Certificates">CA Certificate module owner</a>
  and peers to evaluate new CA requests on our behalf and to make decisions
  regarding all matters relating to CA certificates included in our root store.</p>
  <p>Further, Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Mozilla_CA_Certificate_Policy">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy module
  owner</a> and peers to maintain this policy. The policy will
  only be changed after public consultation with the Mozilla community, in order
  to ensure that all views are taken into account. This policy MAY be updated periodically in accordance with the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Updating_Root_Store_Policy">Process for Updating the Root Store Policy</a>. CA operators MUST adhere to the current version of this policy. You can contact the Mozilla CA
  Certificate Policy module team at <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> if you
  have questions about this policy.</p>
  <p>CA operators or others objecting to a particular decision by either team MAY appeal to
  the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox_Technical_Leadership">Firefox Technical Leadership Module Committee</a> who will make a final
  decision.</p>
  <h2 id="2-certificate-authorities">2. Certificate Authorities</h2>
  <h3 id="21-ca-operations">2.1 CA Operations</h3>
  <p>CA operators whose certificates are included in Mozilla's root store MUST:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>provide some service relevant to users of our software
        products;</li>
    <li>follow industry best practice for securing their networks, for example
        by conforming to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/network-security-requirements/">CA/Browser Forum's Network and Certificate System Security Requirements</a> or a
        successor document;</li>
    <li>enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of causing
        certificate issuance or performing Registration Authority or Delegated
        Third Party functions, or implement technical controls operated by the CA
        to restrict certificate issuance through the account to a limited set of
        pre-approved domains or email addresses;</li>
    <li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate
        requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
        purpose(s) of the certificates;</li>
    <li>verify that all of the information that is included in server certificates remains current and correct at intervals of 825 days or less;
      <p>5.1. for server certificates issued on or after October 1, 2021, each dNSName or IPAddress in a SAN or commonName MUST have been validated in accordance with section 3.2.2 of the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements within the preceding 398 days;</p>
    </li>
    <li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
        deem acceptable; <em>and</em></li>
    <li>ensure that all certificates within the scope of this policy,
        as described in Section 1.1, adhere to this policy.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>CA operators MUST follow and be aware of discussions in
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy">Mozilla's dev-security-policy</a> forum, where Mozilla's root store is
  coordinated. They are encouraged, but not required, to contribute to those
  discussions.</p>
  <h3 id="22-validation-practices">2.2 Validation Practices</h3>
  <p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be acceptable if it
  meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>all information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
        MUST be verified by using an independent source of information
        or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
        the certificate;</li>
    <li>for a certificate capable of being used for digitally signing or encrypting
        email messages, the CA operator MUST take reasonable measures to verify that
        the entity submitting the request controls the email account
        associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
        <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
        the account holder’s behalf. The CA operator SHALL NOT delegate validation
        of the domain portion of an email address. The CA MAY rely
        on validation the CA has performed for
        an Authorization Domain Name (as specified in the Baseline Requirements)
        as being valid for subdomains of that Authorization Domain Name.
        The CA operator's CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the procedure(s)
        that the CA employs to perform this verification;</li>
    <li>for a certificate capable of being used for TLS-enabled servers, the CA
        MUST ensure that the applicant has registered all domain(s) referenced
        in the certificate or has been authorized by the domain registrant to
        act on their behalf. This MUST be done using one or more of the
        methods documented in section 3.2.2.4 of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. The CA operator's
        CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) must clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
        each documented procedure SHOULD state which subsection of 3.2.2.4 it is
        complying with. CAs are not permitted to use 3.2.2.5 (4) ("any other method")
        to fulfill the requirements of method 3.2.2.4.8 (IP Address);</li>
    <li>for a certificate capable of being used for TLS-enabled servers, the CA
        MUST ensure that the applicant has control over all IP Address(es) referenced
        in the certificate. This MUST be done using one or more of the
        methods documented in section 3.2.2.5 of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. The CA operator's
        CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
        each documented procedure SHOULD state which subsection of 3.2.2.5 it is
        complying with; <em>and</em></li>
    <li>for certificates marked as Extended Validation, CA operators MUST comply with the
        latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/">Guidelines for the Issuance and Management of
        Extended Validation Certificates</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Validation methods are occasionally found to contain security flaws. When this happens,
  Mozilla expects CA operators to evaluate their practices and respond appropriately to mitigate the risk.
  Mozilla MAY require CAs to make disclosures or modifications, up to and including
  immediately discontinuing use of a method.</p>
  <h3 id="23-baseline-requirements-conformance">2.3 Baseline Requirements Conformance</h3>
  <p>CA operations relating to issuance of certificates capable of being used for
  TLS-enabled servers MUST also conform to the latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser
  Forum Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted
  Certificates</a> ("Baseline Requirements"). In the event of inconsistency
  between this policy's requirements and the Baseline Requirements,
  this policy's requirements take precedence. The following is a list of known
  places where this policy takes precedence over the Baseline Requirements. If
  you find an inconsistency that is not listed here, notify Mozilla so the item
  can be considered for addition or clarification.</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>Insofar as the Baseline Requirements attempt to define their own scope, the
        scope of this policy (section 1.1) overrides that. CA
        operations relating to issuance of <strong>all</strong> TLS server certificates in the scope of
        this policy SHALL conform to the Baseline Requirements.</li>
    <li>Mozilla MAY accept audits by auditors who do not meet the
        qualifications given in section 8.2 of the Baseline Requirements, or refuse
        audits from auditors who do.</li>
    <li>Mozilla MAY restrict permitted algorithms to a subset of those allowed by the
        Baseline Requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="24-incidents">2.4 Incidents</h3>
  <p>When a CA operator fails to comply with any requirement of this policy - whether it be
  a misissuance, a procedural or operational issue, or any other variety of
  non-compliance - the event is classified as an incident and MUST be reported to Mozilla as soon as the CA operator is made aware. At a minimum, CA operators MUST promptly report all incidents to Mozilla in the form of an <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident">Incident Report</a>. Any matter documented in an audit as a qualification, a modified opinion, or a major non-conformity is also considered an incident and MUST have a corresponding Incident Report. CA operators
  MUST regularly update the Incident Report until the corresponding bug
  is marked as resolved in the mozilla.org <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a> system by a Mozilla representative.
  CA operators SHOULD cease issuance until the problem has been prevented from reoccurring.  </p>
  <p>Mozilla expects the timely remediation of the problems that caused or gave rise to the incident. In response to incidents, Mozilla MAY require the CA operator to submit a plan of action with milestones or to submit one or more additional audits to provide sufficient assurance that the incident has been remediated. Such audits MAY be expected sooner than the CA operator’s next scheduled audit, and thus MAY be expected to be for a period less than a year.</p>
  <h2 id="3-documentation">3. Documentation</h2>
  <h3 id="31-audits">3.1 Audits</h3>
  <p>Before being included and at least annually thereafter, CA operators MUST obtain certain
  audits for their root certificates and all intermediate certificates
  that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates.
  This section describes the requirements for those audits.</p>

  </ul>
  <h4 id="313-audit-parameters">3.1.3 Audit Parameters</h4>
  <p>Full-surveillance period-of-time audits MUST be conducted and updated audit
  information provided no less frequently than <strong>annually</strong> from the time of CA key pair generation until the CA public key is no longer trusted by Mozilla's root store. This cradle-to-grave audit requirement applies equally to intermediate CAs as it does to root CAs. Successive period-of-time audits
  MUST be contiguous (no gaps).</p>
  <p>Point-in-time audit statements MAY be used to confirm that all of the problems
  that an auditor previously identified in a qualified audit statement have been
  corrected. However, a point-in-time audit does not replace the
  period-of-time audit.</p>
  <p>Audit reports that are being supplied to maintain a certificate within the
  Mozilla root store MUST be provided to Mozilla via the CCADB within three
  months of the point-in-time date or the end date of the period.</p>
  <h4 id="314-public-audit-information">3.1.4 Public Audit Information</h4>
  <p>The publicly-available documentation relating to each audit MUST contain at
  least the following clearly-labelled information:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>name of the company being audited;</li>
    <li>name and address of the organization performing the audit;</li>
    <li>name of the lead auditor and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Audit_Statements#Auditor_Qualifications">qualifications of the team</a> performing the audit, as required by section 3.2; </li>
    <li>Distinguished Name and SHA256 fingerprint of each root and intermediate
        certificate that was in scope;</li>
    <li>audit criteria (with version number) that were used to audit each of
        the certificates;</li>
    <li>a list of the CA policy documents (with version numbers) referenced during
        the audit;</li>
    <li>whether the audit is for a period of time or a point in time;</li>
    <li>the start date and end date of the period, for those that cover a period
        of time;</li>
    <li>the point-in-time date, for those that are for a point in time;</li>
    <li>the date the report was issued (which will necessarily be after the end
        date or point-in-time date); </li>
    <li>all incidents (as defined in section 2.4) disclosed by the CA, discovered by the auditor, or reported by a third party, that, at any time during the audit period, occurred or were open in Bugzilla;</li>
    <li>the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Audit_Statements#Audited_Locations">CA locations that were or were not audited</a>; <em>and</em></li>
    <li>for ETSI, a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit, and which
        parts of the criteria were applied, e.g. DVCP, OVCP, NCP, NCP+, LCP, EVCP,
        EVCP+, QCP-w, Part1 (General Requirements), and/or Part 2 (Requirements for
        trust service providers).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>An authoritative English language version of the publicly-available audit information MUST be supplied by the Auditor.</p>
  <p>If Mozilla determines that an audit provided does not meet the requirements of this policy, then Mozilla MAY require that the CA operator obtain a new audit, at the CA operator's expense, for the period of time in question. Additionally, depending on the nature of concerns with the audit, Mozilla MAY require that the CA operator obtain such an audit from a new auditor.</p>
  <h3 id="32-auditors">3.2 Auditors</h3>
  <p>In normal circumstances, Mozilla requires that audits MUST be performed
  by a Qualified Auditor, as defined in the Baseline Requirements, section 8.2.</p>
  <p>A Qualified Auditor MUST have relevant IT Security experience, or have audited a number of CAs, and be independent. ETSI Audit Attestation Letters MUST follow the Audit Attestation Letter template on the <a href="https://www.acab-c.com/downloads">ACAB'c website</a>, and ETSI auditors MUST be members of the <a href="https://www.acab-c.com/members/">Accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies' Council</a> and follow the ACAB'c Charter and Code of Conduct. WebTrust audit statements MUST follow the practitioner guidance, principles, and illustrative assurance reports on the <a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/audit-and-assurance/overview-of-webtrust-services/principles-and-criteria">CPA Canada website</a>, and WebTrust auditors MUST be listed as <a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/audit-and-assurance/overview-of-webtrust-services/licensed-webtrust-practitioners-international">enrolled WebTrust practitioners</a> on the CPA Canada website. Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, decide to temporarily waive membership or enrollment requirements.</p>
  <p>Each Audit Report MUST be accompanied by documentation provided to Mozilla of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Audit_Statements#Auditor_Qualifications">audit team qualifications</a> sufficient for Mozilla to determine the competence, experience, and independence of the auditor. </p>
  <p>If a CA operator wishes to use auditors who do not fit the definition of Qualified Auditor, then it MUST

  issuing certificates), as described in section 6.1.7 of the
  <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>
  <p>CA operators MUST maintain current best practices to prevent
  algorithm attacks against certificates. As such, all new certificates

  </ul>
  <p>CA operators MUST NOT generate the key pairs for end entity certificates that have an

  KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension. </p>
  <p>If the intermediate CA certificate includes the id-kp-serverAuth extended key usage,
  then to be considered technically constrained, the certificate MUST be Name Constrained as described in section
  7.1.5 of version 1.3 or later of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>. The id-kp-clientAuth EKU MAY also be present.
  The conformance requirements defined in section 2.3 of this policy also apply to
  technically constrained intermediate certificates.</p>
  <p>If the intermediate CA certificate includes the id-kp-emailProtection extended key
  usage, then to be considered technically
  constrained, it MUST include the Name Constraints X.509v3 extension with
  constraints on rfc822Name, with at least one name in permittedSubtrees,
  each such name having its ownership validated according to section
  3.2.2.4 of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>. The values id-kp-serverAuth and anyExtendedKeyUsage MUST NOT be present. id-kp-clientAuth MAY be present.

  <h4 id="532-publicly-disclosed-and-audited">5.3.2 Publicly Disclosed and Audited</h4>
  <p>The operator of a CA certificate included in Mozilla’s root store MUST publicly disclose in the CCADB all CA certificates they issue that chain up to that CA certificate trusted in Mozilla’s root store that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates, including those CA certificates that share the same key pair whether they are self-signed, doppelgänger, reissued, cross-signed, or other roots. The CA operator with a certificate included in Mozilla’s root store MUST disclose  such CA certificate within one week of certificate creation, and before any such CA is allowed to issue certificates. Name-constrained CA certificates that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates that were exempt from disclosure in previous versions of this policy MUST be disclosed in the CCADB prior to July 1, 2022. </p>
  <p>All disclosure MUST be made freely available and without additional requirements, including, but not limited to, registration, legal agreements, or restrictions on redistribution of the certificates in whole or in part.</p>
  <p>We recognize that technically constraining intermediate
  certificates as described above may not be practical in some cases.
  All certificates that are capable of being used to issue new
  certificates, that are not technically constrained, and that
  directly or transitively chain to a certificate included in
  Mozilla’s root store MUST be audited in accordance with this policy.
  If the CA operator has a currently valid audit report at the time of creation
  of the intermediate certificate, then the new intermediate certificate MUST appear on the
  CA operator's next periodic audit reports.</p>
  <h3 id="54-precertificates">5.4 Precertificates</h3>

"Final certificate" means a certificate that is not a precertificate. Precertificates are in-scope for enforcing compliance with these requirements. A final certificate is "based on" a precertificate if they have the same serial and issuer, or they have the same serial and the final certificate's issuer matches the precertificate's issuer's issuer. Thus,</p>

  more than ten days beyond the value of the thisUpdate field.</p>
  <p>For end entity certificates, if the CA provides revocation information
  via an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) service:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>it MUST update that service at least every four days; </li>
    <li>responses MUST have a defined value in the nextUpdate field, and it

  </ul>
  <p>Section 4.9.12 of a CA operator's CPS (or, if applicable, the CP or CP/CPS) MUST clearly specify the methods that parties may use to demonstrate private key compromise.</p>
  <h3 id="61-tls">6.1 TLS</h3>
  <p>For any certificate in a hierarchy capable of being used for
  TLS-enabled servers, CAs MUST revoke certificates that they have
  issued upon the occurrence of any event listed in the appropriate
  subsection of section 4.9.1 of the Baseline Requirements,
  according to the timeline defined therein. CAs MUST also revoke
  any certificates issued in violation of the then-current version
  of these requirements according to the timeline defined in
  section 4.9.1 of the Baseline Requirements.</p>
  <h4 id="611-end-entity-tls-certificate-crlrevocation-reasons">6.1.1 End Entity TLS Certificate CRLRevocation Reasons</h4>
  <p>This section applies to revocations that are performed after October 1, 2022. Revocation entries that appeared on a CRL prior to October 1, 2022, do NOT need to be changed as a result of this section.</p>
  <p>When an end entity TLS certificate (i.e. a certificate capable of being used for TLS-enabled servers) is revoked for one of the reasons below, the specified CRLReason MUST be included in the reasonCode extension of the CRL entry corresponding to the end entity TLS certificate. When the CRLReason code is not one of the following, then the reasonCode extension MUST NOT be provided:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>keyCompromise (RFC 5280 CRLReason #1);</li>
    <li>privilegeWithdrawn (RFC 5280 CRLReason #9);</li>
    <li>cessationOfOperation (RFC 5280 CRLReason #5);</li>
    <li>affiliationChanged (RFC 5280 CRLReason #3); </em>or</em></li>
    <li>superseded (RFC 5280 CRLReason #4).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The CA operator's subscriber agreement for TLS end entity certificates MUST inform certificate subscribers about the revocation reason options listed above and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Reasons">provide explanation about when to choose each option</a>. Tools that the CA operator provides to the certificate subscriber MUST allow for these options to be easily specified when the certificate subscriber requests revocation of their certificate, with the default value being that no revocation reason is provided (i.e. the default corresponds to the CRLReason “unspecified (0)” which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL). </p>
  <p>** The privilegeWithdrawn reasonCode does not need to be made available to the certificate subscriber as a revocation reason option, because the use of this reasonCode is determined by the CA operator and not the subscriber.</p>
  <p>If the certificate is revoked for a reason not listed below, then the reasonCode extension MUST NOT be provided in the CRL.</p>
  <p><strong>keyCompromise</strong> </p>
  <p>The CRLReason keyCompromise MUST be used when one or more of the following occurs:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the CA operator obtains verifiable evidence that the certificate subscriber’s private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate suffered a key compromise;</li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the certificate subscriber’s private key to compromise;</li>
    <li>there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the private key was flawed;</li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the certificate subscriber’s private key based on the public key in the certificate (such as a Debian weak key, see https://wiki.debian.org/TLSkeys); <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the certificate subscriber requests that the CA operator revoke the certificate for this reason, with the scope of revocation being described below.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The scope of revocation depends on whether the certificate subscriber has proven possession of the private key of the certificate. A CSR alone does not prove possession of the certificate’s private key for the purpose of initiating a revocation.</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>If anyone requesting revocation for keyCompromise has previously demonstrated or can currently <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Reasons#Possession_of_Private_Key">demonstrate possession of the private key of the certificate</a>, then the CA operator MUST revoke all instances of that key across all subscribers.</li>
    <li>If the certificate subscriber requests that the CA operator revoke the certificate for keyCompromise, and has not previously demonstrated and cannot currently demonstrate possession of the associated private key of that certificate, the CA operator MAY revoke all certificates associated with that subscriber that contain that public key. The CA operator MUST NOT assume that it has evidence of private key compromise for the purposes of revoking the certificates of other subscribers, but MAY block issuance of future certificates with that key.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When the CA operator obtains verifiable evidence of private key compromise for a certificate whose CRL entry does not contain a reasonCode extension or has a reasonCode extension with a non-keyCompromise reason, the CA operator SHOULD update the CRL entry to enter keyCompromise as the CRLReason in the reasonCode extension.  Additionally, the CA operator SHOULD update the revocation date in a CRL entry when it is determined that the private key of the certificate was compromised prior to the revocation date that is indicated in the CRL entry for that certificate. </p>
  <p>Note: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Reasons#Updating_CRL_Entries">Backdating the revocationDate field</a> is an exception to best practice described in RFC 5280 (section 5.3.2); however, this policy specifies the use of the revocationDate field to support TLS implementations that process the revocationDate field as the date when the certificate is first considered to be compromised.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, the keyCompromise CRLReason MUST NOT be used.</p>
  <p><strong>privilegeWithdrawn</strong></p>
  <p>The CRLReason privilegeWithdrawn is intended to be used when there has been a subscriber-side infraction that has not resulted in keyCompromise, such as the certificate subscriber provided misleading information in their certificate request or has not upheld their material obligations under the subscriber agreement or terms of use.</p>
  <p>Unless the keyCompromise CRLReason is being used, the CRLReason privilegeWithdrawn MUST be used when:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the CA operator obtains evidence that the certificate was misused;</li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware that the certificate subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the subscriber agreement or terms of use;</li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware that a wildcard certificate has been used to authenticate a fraudulently misleading subordinate fully‐qualified domain name;</li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the certificate;</li>
    <li>the CA operator determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the certificate is inaccurate; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware that the original certificate request was not authorized and that the Subscriber does not retroactively grant authorization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Otherwise, the privilegeWithdrawn CRLReason MUST NOT be used.</p>
  <p><strong>cessationOfOperation</strong></p>
  <p>The CRLReason cessationOfOperation is intended to be used when the website with the certificate is shut down prior to the expiration of the certificate, or if the subscriber no longer owns or controls the domain name in the certificate. This revocation reason is intended to be used in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate subscriber no longer controls, or is no longer authorized to use, all of the domain names in the certificate;</li>
    <li>the certificate subscriber will no longer be using the certificate because they are discontinuing their website; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the CA operator is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a fully‐qualified domain name or IP address in the certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a domain name registrant’s right to use the domain name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the domain name registrant and the applicant has terminated, or the domain name registrant has failed to renew the domain name).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unless the keyCompromise CRLReason is being used, the CRLReason cessationOfOperation MUST be used when:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate subscriber has requested that their certificate be revoked for this reason; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the CA operator has received verifiable evidence that the certificate subscriber no longer controls, or is no longer authorized to use, all of the domain names in the certificate. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Otherwise, the cessationOfOperation CRLReason MUST NOT be used.</p>
  <p><strong>affiliationChanged</strong> </p>
  <p>The CRLReason affiliationChanged is intended to be used to indicate that the subject's name or other subject identity information in the certificate has changed, but there is no cause to suspect that the certificate’s private key has been compromised. </p>
  <p>Unless the keyCompromise CRLReason is being used, the CRLReason affiliationChanged MUST be used when:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate subscriber has requested that their certificate be revoked for this reason; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the CA operator has replaced the certificate due to changes in the certificate’s subject information and the CA has not replaced the certificate for the other reasons: keyCompromise, superseded, cessationOfOperation, or privilegeWithdrawn. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Otherwise, the affiliationChanged CRLReason MUST NOT be used.</p>
  <p><strong>superseded</strong></p>
  <p>The CRLReason superseded is intended to be used to indicate when:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate subscriber has requested a new certificate to replace an existing certificate; or</li>
    <li>the CA operator obtains reasonable evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any fully‐qualified domain name or IP address in the certificate should not be relied upon; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the CA operator has revoked the certificate for compliance reasons such as the certificate does not comply with this policy, the CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements, or the CA operator’s CP or CPS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unless the keyCompromise CRLReason is being used, the CRLReason superseded MUST be used when:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate subscriber has requested that their certificate be revoked for this reason; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the CA operator has revoked the certificate due to domain authorization or compliance issues other than those related to keyCompromise or privilegeWithdrawn.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Otherwise, the superseded CRLReason MUST NOT be used.</p>
  <h3 id="62-smime">6.2 S/MIME</h3>
  <p>For any certificate in a hierarchy capable of being used for
  S/MIME, CA operators MUST revoke certificates upon the occurrence of
  any of the following events:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the subscriber indicates that the original certificate request
      was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;</li>
    <li>the CA operator obtains reasonable evidence that the subscriber’s
      private key (corresponding to the public key in the certificate)
      has been compromised or is suspected of compromise;</li>
    <li>the CA operator obtains reasonable evidence that the certificate
      has been used for a purpose outside of that indicated
      in the certificate or in the CA operator's subscriber agreement;</li>
    <li>the CA operator receives notice or otherwise becomes aware that a
      subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations
      under the subscriber agreement;</li>
    <li>the CA operator receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any circumstance
      indicating that use of the email address in the certificate
      is no longer legally permitted;</li>
    <li>the CA operator receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of a material change
      in the information contained in the certificate;</li>
    <li>a determination that the certificate was not issued in accordance
      with the CA operator’s Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;</li>
    <li>the CA operator determines that any of the information
      appearing in the certificate is not accurate;</li>
    <li>the CA operator ceases operations for any reason and has not arranged
      for another CA operator to provide revocation support for the certificate;</li>
    <li>the CA private key used in issuing the certificate is suspected
      to have been compromised;</li>
    <li>such additional revocation events as the CA operator publishes
      in its policy documentation; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the certificate was issued in violation of the then-current

  <h2 id="7-root-store-changes">7. Root Store Changes</h2>
  <p>Changes that are motivated by a security concern such as certificate

  security-sensitive, and a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;groups=crypto-core-security">secure bug filed in Bugzilla</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="71-inclusions">7.1 Inclusions</h3>
  <p>We will determine which CA certificates are included in Mozilla's root store
  based on the risks of
  such inclusion to typical users of our products. We will consider adding
  additional CA certificates to the default certificate set upon request only by
  an authorized representative of the subject CA. We will make such decisions
  through a public process.</p>
  <p>We will not charge any fees to have a CA operator’s certificate(s)
  included in Mozilla's root store.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to not include certificates from a particular CA operator in
  our root store. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
  where we believe that a CA operator has caused undue risks to users’
  security, e.g. by knowingly issuing certificates without the knowledge of the
  entities whose information is referenced in those certificates ('MITM certificates').
  Mozilla is under no obligation to explain the reasoning behind any inclusion decision.</p>
  <p>Before being included, CA operators MUST provide evidence that their CA certificates fully comply with the current Mozilla Root Store Requirements and Baseline Requirements, and have continually, from the time of CA private key creation, complied with the then-current Mozilla Root Store Policy and Baseline Requirements. </p>
  <p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to Mozilla's root store, a CA operator
  SHOULD submit a formal request by submitting a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Root%20Program">bug report</a>
  into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA
  Certificate Root Program" component of the "NSS" product. Mozilla’s wiki
  page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>", provides
  further details about how to submit a formal request. The request
  MUST be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA operator, and
  MUST include the following:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
        certificate(s) requested for inclusion;</li>
    <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
        the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
        within the certificate hierarchy associated with the CA
        certificate:
        <ul>
          <li>TLS-enabled servers</li>
          <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
        issues Extended Validation certificates within the certificate hierarchy
        associated with the CA certificate and, if so, the EV policy
        OID associated with the CA certificate;</li>
    <li>a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (or
        links to a CP and CPS) or equivalent disclosure document(s)
        for the CA or CAs in question; </li>
    <li>an auditor-witnessed root key generation ceremony report and contiguous
        period-of-time audit reports performed thereafter no less frequently than
        annually; <em>and</em></li>
    <li>information as to how the CA operator has fulfilled the requirements
        stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
        requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
        criteria.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We will reject requests where the CA operator does not provide such
  information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
  request.</p>
  <h3 id="72-updates">7.2 Updates</h3>
  <p>Changes MAY be made to CA certificates that are included in
  Mozilla's root store as follows:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>enabling a trust bit in a CA certificate that is currently
      included, MAY only be done after careful consideration of the
      CA operator’s current policies, practices, and audits,
      and MAY be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>";</li>
    <li>enabling EV in a CA certificate that is currently included,

      <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Certificate_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="73-removals">7.3 Removals</h3>
  <p>Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, decide to disable (partially or fully) or
  remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. This MAY happen
  immediately or on a planned future date. Mozilla will
  disable or remove a certificate if the CA operator demonstrates ongoing or
  egregious practices that do not maintain the expected level of service
  or that do not comply with the requirements of this policy.</p>
  <p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
  if we learn that a CA operator has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
  or more certificates. This MAY include, but is not limited to,
  disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all the CA operator’s
  certificates from Mozilla’s root store.</p>
  <p>The category of mis-issued certificates includes (but is not limited to) those
  issued to someone who should not have received them, those containing
  information which was not properly validated, those having incorrect technical
  constraints, and those using algorithms other than those permitted.</p>
  <p>A failure to provide notifications or updates in the CCADB or
  as otherwise required in a timely manner SHALL also be grounds for
  disabling a CA operator’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla's root
  store. For this policy and the CCADB policies, "a timely manner" means
  within 30 days of when the appropriate data or documentation becomes
  available to the CA operator, unless a Mozilla policy document specifies a different
  rule.</p>
  <p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA operator’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
  root store based on a CA operator’s actions (or failure to act) that are
  contrary to this policy, Mozilla will publicize
  that fact (for example, in newsgroups on the
  news.mozilla.org server, and on our websites) and MAY also alert
  relevant news or government organizations such as US-CERT.</p>
  <h2 id="8-ca-operational-changes">8. CA Operational Changes</h2>
  <p>CA operators SHALL NOT assume that trust is transferable. All CA operators whose certificates
  are included in Mozilla's root store MUST <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">notify Mozilla</a> before:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>ownership or control of the CA’s certificate(s) changes;</li>
    <li>an organization other than the CA operator obtains control of an unconstrained
    intermediate certificate (as defined in section 5.3 of this policy) that
    directly or transitively chains to a certificate included in Mozilla's root store - see <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a>;</li>
    <li>ownership or control of the CA’s operations changes; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>there is a change in the CA's operations that could affect the CA's ability to comply with the requirements of this Policy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>CA operators SHOULD err on the side of notification if there is any doubt. Mozilla will
  normally keep commercially sensitive information confidential. Throughout any
  change, CA operations MUST continue to meet the requirements of this policy. If
  one of the above events occurs, Mozilla MAY require additional audit(s) as a
  condition of remaining in the root store. CA operators are encouraged to notify Mozilla in
  advance in order to avoid unfortunate surprises.</p>
  <p>In addition, one or more of the following sections MAY apply.</p>
  <h3 id="81-change-in-legal-ownership">8.1 Change in Legal Ownership</h3>
  <p>This section applies when one company buys or takes a controlling stake in
  a CA or CA operator, or when an organization obtains control of a CA key pair that is
  within the scope of Mozilla's root store, unless it is constrained in
  compliance with section 5.3.1 of this policy.</p>
  <p>Mozilla MUST be notified of any resulting changes in the CA operator's CP, CPS, or combined CP/CPS.</p>
  <p>If the receiving or acquiring company is new to the Mozilla root store,
  it MUST demonstrate compliance with the entirety of this policy. There
  MUST be a public discussion regarding its admittance to the root store.
  If Mozilla reaches a positive conclusion after public discussion, then the affected certificate(s) MAY remain in the root store. If the entire
  CA operation is not included in the scope of the transaction, issuance is not
  permitted until the discussion has been resolved with a positive conclusion.</p>
  <h3 id="82-change-in-operational-personnel">8.2 Change in Operational Personnel</h3>
  <p>This section applies when operation of a CA certificate that is within the
  scope of Mozilla's root store and not constrained in compliance with section
  5.3.1 of this policy is transferred to a different organization,
  whether by acquisition or contract.</p>
  <p>The transferor MUST ensure that the transferee is able to fully comply with
  this policy. The transferor will continue to be responsible for the root
  certificate's private key until Mozilla has been provided with an audit
  statement (or opinion letter) confirming successful transfer of the root
  certificate and key. Issuance MUST NOT occur until the transferee
  has provided all the information required by the CCADB, and demonstrated to
  Mozilla that they have all the appropriate audits, CP/CPS documents, and other
  systems in place.</p>
  <p>The transferor MUST notify Mozilla about any necessary changes to EV status or
  trust bits in Mozilla's root store. If the transferee will be technically capable of issuing EV certificates, the transferor MUST confirm that the
  transferee has or will get the relevant audits before issuing EV certificates.</p>
  <h3 id="83-change-in-secure-location">8.3 Change in Secure Location</h3>
  <p>This section only applies when section 8.1 and/or section 8.2 applies, and when the
  cryptographic hardware related to a CA certificate that is within the scope of
  Mozilla's root store and not constrained in compliance with section
  5.3.1 of this policy is consequently moved from one secure location to another.</p>
  <p>This policy and the relevant WebTrust or ETSI requirements apply at all times,
  even during the physical relocation of a CA's online operations to a new data
  center and moving parts of an offline root certificate from one location to
  another. As such, a CA operator MUST always ensure that physical access to CA equipment
  is limited to authorized individuals, the equipment is operated under multiple
  person control, and unauthorized CA system usage is able to be detected at all
  times. The auditor MUST confirm that there are appropriate procedures in place
  to ensure that the requirements are met and that those procedures are followed.</p>
  <p>The following steps MUST be taken by the organization(s) concerned:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>ensure that annual audit statements are current;</li>
    <li>notify Mozilla of the pending change;</li>
    <li>create a transfer plan (and legal agreement if more than one organization is
      involved) and have it reviewed by the auditors;</li>
    <li>stop new certificate issuance at the current site before the transfer begins;</li>
    <li>have an audit performed at the current site to confirm when the root
      certificate is ready for transfer, and ensure that key material is
      properly secured;</li>
    <li>have the transfer ceremony witnessed by auditors and video recorded,
      with a physical exchange of the HSM or ciphertext containing the associated key
      material and certificates, and the multi-party authorization keys;</li>
    <li>perform an audit at the new site to confirm that the transfer was successful,
      that the private key remained secure throughout the transfer, and that the root
      certificate is ready to resume issuance. This requirement MAY be met by
      including the transferred root certificate and key in the new owner's regular
      audits or by getting a point-in-time audit; <em>and</em></li>
    <li>send links to the updated CP, CPS, and the updated audit statements, opinion
      letter, or point-in-time audit statement to Mozilla.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The regular annual audit statements MUST still happen in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>The organization(s) concerned MUST immediately <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;groups=crypto-core-security">send a security report to
  Mozilla</a> if a problem occurs.</p>
  <h2 id="84-externally-operated-subordinate-cas">8.4 Externally-Operated Subordinate CAs</h2>
  <p>The operator of a root CA certificate that is included in Mozilla’s root store is at all times completely and ultimately accountable for every certificate signed under that root CA certificate, whether directly or through subordinate CAs or cross-certified CAs. The operator of the root CA certificate SHALL ensure that the operator of each subordinate or cross-certified CA fully and continually adheres to this policy.</p>
  <p>The root CA operator MUST complete Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a> (including successful review and approval by Mozilla) before a new externally-operated subordinate CA begins issuing certificates under any of the following conditions:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the subordinate CA operator will obtain a unconstrained (per section 5.3.1 of this policy) CA certificate, and the subordinate CA operator is not approved by Mozilla to issue the type of certificates (email, TLS, or EV TLS), which they will be able to issue under the new CA certificate;</li>
    <li>the root CA operator is cross-signing a CA certificate of a CA operator who is not currently in Mozilla’s root store; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the root CA operator is cross-signing a CA certificate of another CA operator who is currently in Mozilla’s root store, but the other CA operator has not been approved for the same trust bits (email or websites) or EV, and those trust bits or EV will be recognized under the cross-signed certificate that it will be receiving.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to not approve subordinate CA certificates. This includes (but is not limited to) cases where we believe that approval of a subordinate CA operator would cause undue risks to users’ security. Mozilla is under no obligation to explain the reasoning behind such decisions.</p>
  <p>When any of the following conditions apply, the root CA operator is not required to perform Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a> before the subordinate CA certificate begins issuing certificates:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the subordinate CA will be operated directly by the root CA operator under the exact same policies and practices of the root CA operator and within the same scope of audit reporting, and no new organizations will be involved in the management or operation of the CA;</li>
    <li>the CA certificate is technically constrained as described in section 5.3.1 of this policy;</li>
    <li>the subordinate CA operator:
      <ul>
        <li>has previously undergone the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/External_Sub_CAs">Process for non-Technically-Constrained Subordinate CAs</a>; </li>
        <li>has been approved for the type of certificates to be issued (email, TLS, or EV TLS); <em>and</em></li>
        <li>will operate under the same policies and practices as the previous review, and under the same scope of audit reporting as the prior subordinate CA certificate. (Newer versions of policies and practices MAY be used, provided that the subordinate CA operator follows the same versions of the policies for both the existing and new CA certificates.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>as of June 1, 2022, the subordinate CA operator was already trusted for issuing the same type of certificates under an existing subordinate CA certificate that directly or transitively chains to a certificate included in Mozilla’s root store; <em>or</em></li>
    <li>the root CA operator is cross-signing a CA certificate of another CA operator that is currently in Mozilla’s root store, and that other CA operator:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>will only be able to issue the same type of certificate (email, TLS, or EV TLS) that they are already approved for in Mozilla’s root store; <em>and</em> </li>
        <li>will operate both the cross-signed certificate and their CA certificate(s) under the same policies, practices, and scope of audit that their CA certificate was approved for. Newer versions of policies and practices MAY be used, provided that the cross-signed CA operator follows the same versions of the policies for both the cross-signed certificate and their CA certificate(s).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
