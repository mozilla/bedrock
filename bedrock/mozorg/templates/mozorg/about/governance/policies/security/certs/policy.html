  <p><em>Version 2.7</em></p>
  <p><em><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_Store_Policy_Archive">Effective January 1, 2020</a></em></p>
  <h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>When distributing binary and source code versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and
    other Mozilla-related software products, Mozilla includes with such software
    a set of X.509v3 root certificates for various Certification
    Authorities (CAs). The included certificates have their "trust bits"
    set for various purposes, so that the software in question can use the CA
    certificates to anchor a chain of trust for certificates used by SSL servers
    and S/MIME email users without having to ask users for further permission or
    information.</p>
  <p>This policy covers how the default set of certificates and associated trust
    bits is maintained for software products distributed by Mozilla. Other entities
    distributing software based on ours are free to adopt their own policies. In
    particular, under the terms of the relevant Mozilla license(s) distributors of
    such software are permitted to add or delete CA certificates and modify the
    values of the trust bits in the versions that they distribute. However,
    as with other software modifications, by making such changes a distributor MAY
    well affect its ability to use Mozilla trademarks in connection with its
    versions of the software. See the Mozilla trademark policy for more
    information.</p>
  <h3 id="11-scope">1.1 Scope</h3>
  <p>This policy applies, as appropriate, to certificates matching any of the
    following (and the CAs which control or issue them):</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      <p>CA certificates included in, or under consideration for inclusion in, the
        Mozilla root program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Intermediate certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate and which are technically capable of issuing
        working server or email certificates. Intermediate certificates that are not
        considered to be technically capable will contain either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which does not contain any of
          these KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
          id-kp-emailProtection; and/or:
        </li>
        <li>name constraints which do not allow Subject Alternative Names (SANs) of
          any of the following types: dNSName, iPAddress, SRVName, rfc822Name
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>End-entity certificates which have at least one valid, unrevoked chain up
        to such a CA certificate through intermediate certificates which are all in
        scope, such end-entity certificates having either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension which contains one or more of these
          KeyPurposeIds: anyExtendedKeyUsage, id-kp-serverAuth,
          id-kp-emailProtection; or:
        </li>
        <li>no EKU extension.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
  <h3 id="12-policy-ownership">1.2 Policy Ownership</h3>
  <p>Mozilla has appointed a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#CA_Certificates">CA Certificate module
    owner</a>
    and peers to evaluate new CA requests on our behalf and make decisions
    regarding all matters relating to CA certificates included in our root program.</p>
  <p>Further, Mozilla has appointed a <a
          href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Activities#Mozilla_CA_Certificate_Policy">Mozilla CA Certificate Policy
    module
    owner</a> and peers to maintain this policy. The policy will
    only be changed after public consultation with the Mozilla community, in order
    to ensure that all views are taken into account. You can contact the Mozilla CA
    Certificate Policy module team at <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">certificates@mozilla.org</a> if you
    have questions about this policy.</p>
  <p>CAs or others objecting to a particular decision by either team MAY appeal to
    the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox_Technical_Leadership">Firefox Technical Leadership Module
      Committee</a> who will make a final
    decision.</p>
  <h2 id="2-certificate-authorities">2. Certificate Authorities</h2>
  <h3 id="21-ca-operations">2.1 CA Operations</h3>
  <p>CAs whose certificates are included in Mozilla's root program MUST:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>provide some service relevant to users of our software
      products;
    </li>
    <li>follow industry best practice for securing their networks, for example
      by conforming to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/network-security/">CAB Forum Network Security Guidelines</a> or
      a
      successor document;
    </li>
    <li>enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of causing
      certificate issuance or performing Registration Authority or Delegated
      Third Party functions, or implement technical controls operated by the CA
      to restrict certificate issuance through the account to a limited set of
      pre-approved domains or email addresses;
    </li>
    <li>prior to issuing certificates, verify certificate
      requests in a manner that we deem acceptable for the stated
      purpose(s) of the certificates;
    </li>
    <li>verify that all of the information that is included in SSL
      certificates remains current and correct at time intervals of
      825 days or less;
    </li>
    <li>otherwise operate in accordance with published criteria that we
      deem acceptable; and
    </li>
    <li>ensure that all certificates within the scope of this policy,
      as described in Section 1.1, adhere to this policy.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>CAs MUST follow and be aware of discussions in the
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#dev-security-policy">mozilla.dev.security.policy</a> forum, where
    Mozilla's root program is
    coordinated. They are encouraged, but not required, to contribute to those
    discussions.</p>
  <h3 id="22-validation-practices">2.2 Validation Practices</h3>
  <p>We consider verification of certificate signing requests to be acceptable if it
    meets or exceeds the following requirements:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>All information that is supplied by the certificate subscriber
      MUST be verified by using an independent source of information
      or an alternative communication channel before it is included in
      the certificate.
    </li>
    <li>For a certificate capable of being used for digitally signing or encrypting
      email messages, the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that
      the entity submitting the request controls the email account
      associated with the email address referenced in the certificate
      <em>or</em> has been authorized by the email account holder to act on
      the account holder’s behalf. The CA SHALL NOT delegate validation
      of the domain portion of an email address. The CA MAY rely
      on validation the CA has performed for
      an Authorization Domain Name (as specified in the Baseline Requirements)
      as being valid for subdomains of that Authorization Domain Name.
      The CA's CP/CPS must clearly specify the procedure(s)
      that the CA employs to perform this verification.
    </li>
    <li>For a certificate capable of being used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
      must ensure that the applicant has registered all domain(s) referenced
      in the certificate or has been authorized by the domain registrant to
      act on their behalf. This must be done using one or more of the
      methods documented in section 3.2.2.4 of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. The CA's
      CP/CPS must clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
      each documented procedure should state which subsection of 3.2.2.4 it is
      complying with. CAs are not permitted to use 3.2.2.5 (4) ("any other method")
      to fulfill the requirements of method 3.2.2.4.8 (IP Address).
    </li>
    <li>For a certificate capable of being used for SSL-enabled servers, the CA
      must ensure that the applicant has control over all IP Address(es) referenced
      in the certificate. This must be done using one or more of the
      methods documented in section 3.2.2.5 of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. The CA's
      CP/CPS must clearly specify the procedure(s) that the CA employs, and
      each documented procedure should state which subsection of 3.2.2.5 it is
      complying with.
    </li>
    <li>For certificates marked as Extended Validation, the CA MUST comply with the
      latest version of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/extended-validation/">Guidelines for the Issuance and
        Management of
        Extended Validation Certificates</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Validation methods are occasionally found to contain security flaws. When this happens,
    Mozilla expects CAs to evaluate their practices and respond appropriately to mitigate the risk.
    Mozilla may require CAs to make disclosures or modifications, up to and including
    immediately discontinuing use of a method.</p>
  <h3 id="23-baseline-requirements-conformance">2.3 Baseline Requirements Conformance</h3>
  <p>CA operations relating to issuance of certificates capable of being used for
    SSL-enabled servers MUST also conform to the latest version of the <a
            href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">CA/Browser
      Forum Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted
      Certificates</a> ("Baseline Requirements"). In the event of inconsistency
    between Mozilla’s Root Store Policy requirements and the Baseline Requirements,
    Mozilla’s Root Store Policy takes precedence. The following is a list of known
    places where this policy takes precedence over the Baseline Requirements. If
    you find an inconsistency that is not listed here, notify Mozilla so the item
    can be considered for addition or clarification.</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      <p>Insofar as the Baseline Requirements attempt to define their own scope, the
        scope of this policy (section 1.1) overrides that. Mozilla thus requires CA
        operations relating to issuance of <strong>all</strong> SSL certificates in the scope of
        this policy to conform to the Baseline Requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mozilla reserves the right to accept audits by auditors who do not meet the
        qualifications given in section 8.2 of the Baseline Requirements, or refuse
        audits from auditors who do.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Mozilla may restrict permitted algorithms to a subset of those allowed by the
        Baseline Requirements.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="24-incidents">2.4 Incidents</h3>
  <p>When a CA fails to comply with any requirement of this policy - whether it be
    a misissuance, a procedural or operational issue, or any other variety of
    non-compliance - the event is classified as an incident. At a minimum,
    CAs MUST promptly report all incidents to Mozilla in the form of an <a
            href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Responding_To_An_Incident">Incident Report</a>,
    and MUST regularly update the Incident Report until the corresponding bug
    is marked as resolved in the mozilla.org <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org">Bugzilla</a> system by a Mozilla
    representative.
    CAs SHOULD cease issuance until the problem has been prevented from reoccurring.</p>
  <h2 id="3-documentation">3. Documentation</h2>
  <h3 id="31-audits">3.1 Audits</h3>
  <p>Before being included and periodically thereafter, CAs MUST obtain certain
    audits for their root certificates and all of their intermediate certificates
    that are technically capable of issuing working server or email certificates.
    This section describes the requirements for those audits.</p>
  <h4 id="311-audit-criteria">3.1.1 Audit Criteria</h4>

  <h3 id="32-auditors">3.2 Auditors</h3>
  <p>In normal circumstances, Mozilla requires that audits MUST be performed
    by a Qualified Auditor, as defined in the Baseline Requirements section 8.2.</p>
  <p>If a CA wishes to use auditors who do not fit that definition, they MUST

  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>
      <p>the publicly disclosed documentation provides sufficient
        information for Mozilla to determine whether and how the CA

    latest published version of the <a href="http://ccadb.org/policy">Common CCADB Policy</a>, which is
    incorporated here by reference.</p>
  <p>When required by the CCADB Policy, Mozilla’s root program may be contacted

    <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">Baseline Requirements</a>.</p>
  <p>CAs MUST maintain current best practices to prevent

    <li>the CA ceases operations for any reason and has not arranged
      for another CA to provide revocation support for the certificate;
    </li>
    <li>the CA private key used in issuing the certificate is suspected
      to have been compromised;
    </li>
    <li>such additional revocation events as the CA publishes
      in its policy documentation; or
    </li>
    <li>the certificate was issued in violation of the then-current
      version of these requirements.

  <h2 id="7-root-store-changes">7. Root Store Changes</h2>
  <p>Changes that are motivated by a security concern such as certificate
    misissuance or a root or intermediate compromise MUST be treated as a
    security-sensitive, and a <a

      bug filed in Bugzilla</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="71-inclusions">7.1 Inclusions</h3>
  <p>We will determine which CA certificates are included in Mozilla's root program
    based on the risks of
    such inclusion to typical users of our products. We will consider adding
    additional CA certificates to the default certificate set upon request only by
    an authorized representative of the subject CA. We will make such decisions
    through a public process.</p>
  <p>We will not charge any fees to have a CA’s certificate(s)
    included in Mozilla's root program.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to not include certificates from a particular CA in
    our root program. This includes (but is not limited to) cases
    where we believe that a CA has caused undue risks to users’
    security, e.g. by knowingly issuing certificates without the knowledge of the
    entities whose information is referenced in those certificates ('MITM certificates').
    Mozilla is under no obligation to explain the reasoning behind any inclusion decision.</p>
  <p>Before being included, CAs MUST provide evidence that their CA certificates have continually, from the time of
    creation, complied with the then-current Mozilla Root Store Policy and Baseline Requirements.</p>
  <p>To request that its certificate(s) be added to Mozilla's root program a CA
    SHOULD submit a formal request by submitting a <a
            href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Root%20Program">bug
      report</a>
    into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, filed against the "CA
    Certificate Root Program" component of the "NSS" product. Mozilla’s wiki
    page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla products</a>",
    provides
    further details about how to submit a formal request. The request
    MUST be made by an authorized representative of the subject CA, and
    MUST include the following:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>the certificate data (or links to the data) for the CA
      certificate(s) requested for inclusion;
    </li>
    <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether or not
      the CA issues certificates for each of the following purposes
      within the certificate hierarchy associated with the CA
      certificate:
      <ul>
        <li>SSL-enabled servers</li>
        <li>digitally-signed and/or encrypted email;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>for each CA certificate requested for inclusion, whether the CA
      issues Extended Validation certificates within the certificate hierarchy
      associated with the CA certificate and, if so, the EV policy
      OID associated with the CA certificate;
    </li>
    <li>a Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (or
      links to a CP and CPS) or equivalent disclosure document(s)
      for the CA or CAs in question; <em>and</em></li>
    <li>information as to how the CA has fulfilled the requirements
      stated above regarding its verification of certificate signing
      requests and its conformance to a set of acceptable operational
      criteria.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We will reject requests where the CA does not provide such
    information within a reasonable period of time after submitting its
    request.</p>
  <h3 id="72-updates">7.2 Updates</h3>
  <p>Changes MAY be made to root certificates that are included in
    Mozilla's root program as follows:</p>
  <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>enabling a trust bit in a root certificate that is currently
      included, may only be done after careful consideration of the
      CA’s current policies, practices, and audits,
      and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla
        products</a>";
    </li>
    <li>enabling EV in a root certificate that is currently included,
      may only be done after careful consideration of the CA’s current
      policies, practices, and audits,
      and may be requested by a representative of the CA or a
      representative of Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the
      mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in Mozilla’s wiki
      page, "<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Application_Process">Applying for root inclusion in Mozilla
        products</a>";
    </li>
    <li>disabling a root is the act of turning off one or more of the
      trust bits (SSL or email), and may be
      requested by a representative of the CA or a representative of
      Mozilla by submitting a bug report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla
      system, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Certificate_Change_Process">Root Change
        Process</a>;
    </li>
    <li>a representative of the CA or a representative of Mozilla may
      request that a root certificate be removed by submitting a bug
      report into the mozilla.org Bugzilla system, as described in the
      <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Certificate_Change_Process">Root Change Process</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="73-removals">7.3 Removals</h3>
  <p>Mozilla MAY, at its sole discretion, decide to disable (partially or fully) or
    remove a certificate at any time and for any reason. This may happen
    immediately or on a planned future date. Mozilla will
    disable or remove a certificate if the CA demonstrates ongoing or
    egregious practices that do not maintain the expected level of service
    or that do not comply with the requirements of this policy.</p>
  <p>Mozilla will take any steps we deem appropriate to protect our users
    if we learn that a CA has knowingly or intentionally mis-issued one
    or more certificates. This may include, but is not limited to
    disablement (partially or fully) or removal of all of the CA’s
    certificates from Mozilla’s root program.</p>
  <p>The category of mis-issued certificates includes (but is not limited to) those
    issued to someone who should not have received them, those containing
    information which was not properly validated, those having incorrect technical
    constraints, and those using algorithms other than those permitted.</p>
  <p>A failure to provide notifications or updates in the CCADB or
    as otherwise required in a timely manner SHALL also be grounds for
    disabling a CA’s root certificates or removing them from Mozilla's root
    program. For this policy and the CCADB policies, "a timely manner" means
    within 30 days of when the appropriate data or documentation becomes
    available to the CA, unless a Mozilla policy document specifies a different
    rule.</p>
  <p>If Mozilla disables or removes a CA’s certificate(s) from Mozilla’s
    root program based on a CA’s actions (or failure to act) that are
    contrary to the Mozilla Root Store Policy, Mozilla will publicize
    that fact (for example, in newsgroups on the
    news.mozilla.org server, and on our websites) and may also alert
    relevant news or government organizations such as US-CERT.</p>
  <h2 id="8-ca-operational-changes">8. CA Operational Changes</h2>
  <p>CAs SHOULD NOT assume that trust is transferable. All CAs whose certificates
    are included in Mozilla's root program MUST <a href="mailto:certificates@mozilla.org">notify Mozilla</a> if:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>ownership or control of the CA’s certificate(s) changes, or</li>
    <li>an organization other than the CA obtains control of an unconstrained
      intermediate certificate (as defined in section 5.3.2 of this policy) that
      directly or transitively chains to the CA's included certificate(s); or,
    </li>
    <li>ownership or control of the CA’s operations changes; or</li>
    <li>there is a <a href="http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Material+Changes">material change</a> in the
      CA's operations.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>CAs should err on the side of notification if there is any doubt. Mozilla will
    normally keep commercially sensitive information confidential. Throughout any
    change, CA operations MUST continue to meet the requirements of this policy. If
    one of the above events occurs, Mozilla MAY require additional audit(s) as a
    condition of remaining in the root program. CAs are encouraged to notify in
    advance in order to avoid unfortunate surprises.</p>
  <p>In addition, one or more of the following sections MAY apply.</p>
  <h3 id="81-change-in-legal-ownership">8.1 Change in Legal Ownership</h3>
  <p>This section applies when one company buys or takes a controlling stake in
    a CA, or when an organization obtains control of a CA certificate that is
    within the scope of Mozilla's root program, unless it is constrained in
    compliance with section 5.3.1 of this policy.</p>
  <p>Mozilla MUST be notified of any resulting changes in the CA's CP or CPS.</p>
  <p>If the receiving or acquiring company is new to the Mozilla root program,
    it must demonstrate compliance with the entirety of this policy and there
    MUST be a public discussion regarding their admittance to the root program,
    which Mozilla must resolve with a positive conclusion in order for the
    affected certificate(s) to remain in the root program. If the entire
    CA operation is not included in the scope of the transaction, issuance is not
    permitted until the discussion has been resolved with a positive conclusion.</p>
  <h3 id="82-change-in-operational-personnel">8.2 Change in Operational Personnel</h3>
  <p>This section applies when operation of a CA certificate that is within the
    scope of Mozilla's root program and not constrained in compliance with section
    5.3.1 of this policy is transferred to a different organization,
    whether by acquisition or contract.</p>
  <p>The transferor MUST ensure that the transferee is able to fully comply with
    this policy. The transferor will continue to be responsible for the root
    certificate's private key until Mozilla has been provided with an audit
    statement (or opinion letter) confirming successful transfer of the root
    certificate and key. Issuance MUST NOT occur until the transferee
    has provided all the information required by the CCADB, and demonstrated to
    Mozilla that they have all the appropriate audits, CP/CPS documents and other
    systems in place.</p>
  <p>The transferor MUST notify Mozilla about any necessary changes to EV status or
    trust bits in Mozilla's root store. If the transferee is receiving the (right
    to use the) associated EV policy OID(s), the transferor MUST confirm that the
    transferee has or will get the relevant audits before issuing EV certificates.</p>
  <h3 id="83-change-in-secure-location">8.3 Change in Secure Location</h3>
  <p>The section only applies when section 8.1 and/or section 8.2 applies, and when the
    cryptographic hardware related to a CA certificate that is within the scope of
    Mozilla's root program and not constrained in compliance with section
    5.3.1 of this policy is consequently moved from one secure location to another.</p>
  <p>This policy and the relevant WebTrust or ETSI requirements apply at all times,
    even during the physical relocation of a CA's online operations to a new data
    center and moving parts of an offline root certificate from one location to
    another. As such, a CA MUST always ensure that physical access to CA equipment
    is limited to authorized individuals, the equipment is operated under multiple
    person control, and unauthorized CA system usage is able to be detected at all
    times. The auditor MUST confirm that there are appropriate procedures in place
    to ensure that the requirements are met and that those procedures are followed.</p>
  <p>The following steps MUST be taken by the organization(s) concerned:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>Make sure the annual audit statements are current.</li>
    <li>Notify Mozilla of the pending change.</li>
    <li>Create a transfer plan (and legal agreement if more than one organization is
      involved) and have it reviewed by the auditors.
    </li>
    <li>Stop new certificate issuance at the current site before the transfer begins.</li>
    <li>Have an audit performed at the current site to confirm when the root
      certificate is ready for transfer, and to make sure the key material is
      properly secured.
    </li>
    <li>The transfer ceremony should be witnessed by auditors and video recorded,
      with a physical exchange of the HSM or ciphertext containing the associated key
      material and certificates, and the multi-party authorization keys.
    </li>
    <li>At the new site perform an audit to confirm that the transfer was successful,
      that the private key remained secure throughout the transfer, and that the root
      certificate is ready to resume issuance. This requirement may be met by
      including the transferred root certificate and key in the new owner's regular
      audits or by getting a point-in-time audit.
    </li>
    <li>Send links to the updated CP/CPS and the updated audit statements, opinion
      letter, or point-in-time audit statement to Mozilla.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The regular annual audit statements MUST still happen in a timely manner.</p>
  <p>The organization(s) concerned MUST immediately <a
          href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=NSS&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;groups=crypto-core-security">send
    a security report to
    Mozilla</a> if a problem occurs.</p>
