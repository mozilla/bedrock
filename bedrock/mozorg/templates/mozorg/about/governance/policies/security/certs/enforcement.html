A certificate that includes domain names that have not been verified according to the <a href="%s"> CA/Browser Forum’s Baseline Requirement #11.1.1 </a> is considered to be mis-issued.

distribute, and are also permitted to modify the values of the "trust bits" on CA certificates in the default CA certificate set.
