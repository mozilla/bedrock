<h1 class="mzp-c-article-title">Governance</h1>
<p>Mozilla is an <a href="https://opensource.org/">open source</a> project. Our community is structured as a virtual organization. Authority is primarily distributed to both volunteer and employed community members irrespective of employment affiliation as they show their ability through contributions to the project. The project also seeks to debias this system of distributing authority through active interventions that engage and encourage participation from diverse communities.</p>
