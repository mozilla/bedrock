<p>{{_('The Mozilla project is governed by a virtual management team made up of experts from various parts of the community. Some people with leadership roles are employed to work on the Mozilla project and others are not. Leadership roles are primarily granted to individuals based on how active they are in the community, as well as the quality and nature of their contribution. This is a resilient and effective way to guide our global community. The different community leadership roles include:')}} </p>

<p>The ultimate decision-maker is a trusted member of the community who has the final say in the case of disputes. This is a <a href="{{ model_url }}">model</a> followed by many successful open source projects, and they are sometimes called the "benevolent dictator". Mozilla has evolved in the past to have two people in this role, but only has one at present: Mitchell Baker. Mitchell has been in this role since 1999.</p>
