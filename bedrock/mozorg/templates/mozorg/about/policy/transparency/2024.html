  <p>
    Mozilla has traditionally published Transparency reports bi-annually.  The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) creates new reporting requirements and templates for certain platforms — including for some of the platforms operated by Mozilla. It also requires that Mozilla’s reports be published annually, and include information about its moderation and related activities for the entire year.
  </p>
  <p>On February 28, 2025, we published our <a download href="https://assets.mozilla.net/pdf/transparency-report/2024-dsa.pdf">2024 DSA Transparency Report</a>. Because that report was required to follow a specific reporting format, some of the data in that report — such as the number and type of requests we received from law enforcement agencies — is limited to the EU.  The EU requests included in that report are also counted in the global government demand totals listed below.  Other data in the DSA report — such as the number of copyright-related takedown notices we received and actioned — is not tracked country-by-country.  The DSA report therefore contains the same numbers as are indicated here, in our global report.</p>
