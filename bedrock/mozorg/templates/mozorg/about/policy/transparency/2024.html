    Mozilla has traditionally published Transparency reports bi-annually. For 2024, in
    order to comply with the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), Mozilla is including all
    DSA-required data for the year in one report, which is linked below. This report
    does not include certain information that we have traditionally published, such as
    details about our advertising campaigns and policy advocacy. That information will
    be published separately on this page, along with further information about our
    activities outside the EU, in March 2025.
