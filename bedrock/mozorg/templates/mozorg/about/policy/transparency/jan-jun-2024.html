      During the course of this reporting period, Mozilla continued its efforts to protect
      the security and privacy of our users through public policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Europe, we published our <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/07/17/mozillas-policy-vision-for-the-new-eu-mandate-advancing-openness-privacy-fair-competition-and-choice-for-all/">policy recommendations for the new EU mandate</a> outlining
      our position on ensuring greater openness, privacy, fair competition, and meaningful choice online.
      We also <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/03/27/pathways-to-a-fairer-digital-world-shaping-eu-rules-to-increase-consumer-protection-and-choice-online/">contributed</a> to the EU’s process of evaluating consumer protection rules and emphasized
      that such rules should unequivocally incentivise the use and uptake of privacy-enhancing
      technologies to balance personalization and respect for privacy online. At the Computers,
      Privacy and Data Protection (CPDP) conference, we utilized the conference’s strong focus
      on privacy to organize a panel on <a href="https://www.cpdpconferences.org/cpdp-panels/lifting-the-hood-on-big-ai-the-future-of-transparency-and-accountability-in-ai">accountability in AI</a>, highlighting the importance of transparency and responsibility in AI development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building on our work in 2023, we continued to engage in a dialogue with the European
      Commission on the eIDAS legislation published in the official journal. We continued to
      monitor the implementation of Article 45 to ensure encryption and web security are not weakened
      by restricting the independence of browser root store programs to apply strict cybersecurity
      requirements for website authentication.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the United States, we engaged in discussions on comprehensive federal privacy proposals, including the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/04/26/work-gets-underway-on-a-new-federal-privacy-proposal/">American Privacy Protection Act (APRA)</a>. We <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/internet-policy/mozilla-urges-federal-privacy-law-for-ai-development/">testified before Congress</a> on
      the need for a comprehensive federal privacy law to ensure the responsible development of AI.
      We also supported state privacy proposals modeled after the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/01/11/mozilla-weighs-in-on-state-comprehensive-privacy-proposals/">American Data Privacy Protection Act (ADPPA)</a>
      to ensure individuals’ security and privacy on the Internet are fundamental and are not
      treated as optional. Additionally, we co-signed an <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/03/12/nevada-e2ee-amicus/">amicus brief in the Nevada vs. Meta case</a>, defending end-to-end
      encryption to affirm our collective commitment to safeguarding encryption, digital privacy
      and security as fundamental rights. Through our efforts to protect <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/04/26/net-neutrality-is-back/">net neutrality</a>, we highlighted the privacy implications of weakening
      net neutrality in <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1011790221057/1">January's reply comments</a> to the FCC.
    </p>

    <p>
      Globally, through the Global Encryption Coalition Steering Committee, we continue to
      collectively advocate for the protection of encryption against regulatory efforts that aim
      to weaken or undermine it. As a part of our collaborative efforts with GEC SC, we contributed
      to the following activities: We joined allies in signing a <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/06/joint-statement-urging-australia-to-protect-end-to-end-encryption-in-the-online-safety-act-review/">joint statement</a> urging Australia to protect end-to-end encryption in the Online Safety Act review.
      We also signed onto a letter outlining GEC’s <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/04/global-encryption-coalition-gec-sc-contribution-to-the-ongoing-discussions-at-the-uns-global-digital-compact/">concerns</a> about the Belgian Presidency's advocacy to use scanning technologies for
      encrypted messaging services to prevent CSAM, without addressing the security and fundamental
      rights concerns raised by experts. This statement was a follow-up of earlier GEC SC <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/04/statement-of-the-global-encryption-coalitions-steering-committee-on-the-belgian-presidencys-compromise-proposal-on-eu-csam/">comments</a> on the Belgian Presidency’s compromise proposal on EU CSAM.
      We supported a statement delivered as a part of the open consultations on the zero draft of
      the Global Digital Compact, <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Final_GEC-statement-on-the-GDC-Draft-Zero.pdf">articulating</a> the expert insights on protecting
      and extending the use of strong encryption to protect human rights. We also joined GEC SC in <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/05/global-encryption-coalition-steering-committee-statement-in-support-of-the-inclusion-of-encryption-as-a-right-for-every-person-in-chile/">supporting</a> the Chilean government’s inclusion of encryption as a
      right for every person in Chile through its <a href="https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1202434">Cybersecurity Law</a>. In the UK, GEC SC <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/02/comments-of-the-global-encryption-coalition-steering-committee-on-ofcoms/">recommended</a> that
      Ofcom removes E2EE as a risk factor within risk assessments and that the Ofcom guidance be revised.
      GEC SC also outlined <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2024/02/global-encryption-coalition-steering-committee-statement-on-proposed-revisions-to-the-uks-investigatory-powers-act/">concerns</a> on proposed revisions to the UK’s Investigatory Powers Act where the Amendment Bill
      proposed changes that would interfere with the ability of providers to offer strong encryption in
      their products, which in turn would harm the security of users not just in the UK, but around the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The policy team played a strong role in supporting product teams to ensure privacy continues
      to be ingrained in our product offerings. We supported our product teams in testing <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2024/08/22/ppa-update/">Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA)</a> designed to
      measure digital ad effectiveness without compromising user privacy. By using advanced
      cryptographic methods, PPA aggregates data to assess ad impact without tracking individual
      users, aligning with privacy regulations like GDPR. During the course of this reporting period,
      Mozilla continued its efforts to protect the security and privacy of our users through public policy.
