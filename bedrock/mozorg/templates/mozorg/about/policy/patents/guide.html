        <ol type="a">
          <li>{{ _('Even though many software projects and companies who patent believe they are only doing so for defensive purposes, unless you commit to a public patent license that promotes open innovation, you are effectively making the decision to discourage all uses by others of the technologies embodied in your software patents, even if you also license them under an open source copyright license. A separate commitment to open source patent licensing is essential to truly being open source. Even if you don’t own any patents and don’t plan to acquire any, helping us build a community committed to these type of policies and practices helps ensure a future where open source thrives without fear of software patenting.') }}</li>
          <li>{{ _('Much like open source copyright licenses, open source patent licenses create an open ecosystem around your technology can help you to build adoption and value around your product and products that interoperate with it. This could help your business strategy in ways that a completely closed/restrictive patent licensing strategy will not.') }}</li>
