          Mitchell Baker co-founded the Mozilla Project to support the open, innovative web and ensure it continues offering
          opportunities for everyone. As Executive Chair of Mozilla Corporation, Mitchell will represent Mozilla in the public
          with a focus on policy, open source, and community, engaging in areas that touch on Mozilla’s unique history and ethos.
          She’ll also work with the executive leadership team to continue to strengthen and refine how all of Mozilla’s entities
          work together to advance our policy and community goals with greater urgency.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Chairwoman of Mozilla for the last two decades, Mitchell Baker has been responsible for organizing and motivating a
          massive, worldwide, collective of employees and volunteers who are building the internet as a global public resource,
          open and accessible to all. Mitchell is deeply engaged in developing product offerings that promote the mission of
          empowering individuals. She also guides the overall scope and direction of Mozilla’s mission. Mitchell has written the
          key documents that set out Mozilla's enduring mission and commitments — the Mozilla Public License in 1998, the Mozilla
          Manifesto in 2007 and the Mozilla Manifesto Addendum — also known as the Pledge for a Healthy Internet — in 2018.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mitchell is a strong advocate for the open internet, open source, and the importance of connecting technology to its
          impact on individuals and society. She is highly regarded as one of the pioneers of the web and bringing the open
          internet to consumers. She was instrumental in Netscape’s decision in 1998 to release its source code to the public.
          This later led to the release of the Firefox browser and the creation of the Mozilla Foundation as a global technology
          force that spans software product development, educational initiatives, and participatory movements. After co-founding
          the Mozilla Project, Mitchell served as its general manager and CEO from 1999 until January 2008, when the organization’s
          rapid growth encouraged her to split her responsibilities and add a CEO.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mitchell is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Advisory Boards of the Oxford Internet Institute, the
          MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, and the G1 Silicon Valley. She is a Board Member of OpenMRS, Inc., which develops
          open source medical records systems for use in resource-constrained environments. She co-chaired the U.S. Department of
          Commerce Digital Economy Board of Advisors from its inception in March 2016 until August 2017, served on the United Nations
          High Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment, and the ICANN High Level Panel on Global Internet Cooperation and
          Governance Mechanisms. A native of the San Francisco Bay Area, Mitchell received her B.A. in Asian Studies from UC Berkeley
          and her J.D. from Berkeley Law.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>TIME Magazine profiled Mitchell in its global list of “100 Most Influential People” under “Scientists and Thinkers”.
          Bloomberg listed her as one of the “25 Most Influential People on the Web”. She was honored as winner of the Anita Borg
          Institute’s 2009 Women of Vision Award and received the Aenne Burda Award for Creative Leadership in 2010. In 2012, Mitchell
          was inducted into the founding group of the <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductee/mitchell-baker/">Internet
          Society’s Hall of Fame</a>. In 2018 she received the Webby Lifetime Achievement Award. She also received an honorary
          doctorate from the Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. She has written op-eds for the Atlantic and CNN.com and
          appeared on NBC “Meet the Press”, BBC “HardTalk”, “CNN Global Office” , NBC’s “Weekend Today”, France 24, the UK's
          Channel 4 and NPR’s “Morning Edition". She has spoken at high-level events like Tech for Good, VivaTech, Wired NextFest,
          World Economic Forum, Mobile World Congress, Web Summit, Collision and Singularity University.</em>

        <p>Raffi believes that when technology is used both strategically and intentionally, it
          has the power to impact people’s lives — and the world — for the better. This belief has
          guided him throughout his career as an engineer and tech leader, and drives his work
          enabling technological innovation across and beyond Emerson Collective.</p>

        <p>Over the past decades, Raffi has helped companies and organizations build teams
          and tech infrastructure designed for impact. He was an executive at Twitter running a
          global engineering team focused on making Twitter available and performant for the
          world. At Uber, he helped start and run the self-driving efforts tasked with building
          and deploying the first-ever self-driving and passenger carrying fleet in record time.
          His experiences at these industry- and world- changing companies gave him deep
          insight into the importance of thoughtful design and implementation within the
          social media, artificial intelligence, and commercial landscapes.</p>

        <p>When Trump was elected in 2016, Raffi pivoted to put his technological know-how to
          use in the political realm. He joined the Democratic National Committee, as their
          first-ever Chief Technology Officer, to create a unique team fused with campaign and
          industry veterans, to secure the party after its breach by Russian state actors in the
          last presidential election, and to entirely revamp its tech infrastructure — all to
          enable Democrats to win the next few elections.</p>

        <p>Over his four years at Emerson Collective, Raffi has brought his unique ability to
          harness tech talent to the social sector. He works across all teams — and with
          Emerson partners — to consider data, tools, and product design with the aim of
          empowering them to achieve their goals, and making EC a truly data-curious
          organization along the way.</p>

        <p>Raffi is also the host of the Technically Optimistic podcast where he explores the
          intersection of technology with our society. He's had actors, senators, congress
          people, civil society directors, a nobel laureate, and industry professionals as guests.
          In its inaugural season, Technically Optimistic ranked #2 on Apple Podcasts
          technology list while reaching tens of thousands of unique listeners on the release
          day of each episode. Technically Optimistic is now also available as a Substack
          newsletter while Season 2 of the podcast is in production for release in early 2024.</p>

        <p>Raffi is a graduate of M.I.T. He currently serves on numerous boards including TUMO,
          an Armenia-based organization focused on bringing cutting edge STEAM education,
          through an innovative free after-school program, to 50,000 kids in centers in
          Armenia, Lebanon, France, Switzerland, Germany, Ukraine, Albania, and others; the
          Community Tech Alliance, who works to break the cycle of time-intensive patchwork
          solutions that get rebuilt by progressive organizations election cycle to cycle; and
          Medic, a nonprofit organization founded to improve health and health outcomes in
          the world’s hardest-to-reach communities.</p>
