        <p>J. Bob Alotta is a veteran movement builder and executive working at the
          intersection of technology and communities.</p>

        <p>Prior to joining Mozilla, Bob led the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice,
          a global foundation based in New York City that provides critical resources
          to LGBTQI+ activists and artists around the world. Over eight years, they
          quintupled the global footprint of the organization which makes more grants
          in the global majority than any other funder in their sector. Bob specifically
          strengthened movements by adding extra support for digital security, data
          use, and internet freedom to otherwise “non-tech” grants. As chair of the
          Global Philanthropy Project, Bob helped secure the largest bilateral and
          multilateral investments to date for LGBTQI+ communities worldwide. Bob
          was an early architect of the “feminist internet” and the creator of
          CommsLabs, bringing queer human rights defenders and technologists together.
          Bob builds bridges between the LGBTQI+ and digital rights worlds.</p>

        <p>Now serving as Senior Vice President of Global Programs at Mozilla
          Foundation, Bob brings their experience as a movement strategist to leverage
          the organizations’ programs to shift power back to people instead of “big”
          tech. Through the lens of trustworthy AI, Bob has launched the African
          Innovation Mradi, the Data Futures Lab, the Mozilla Technology Fund, the
          Creative Media Awards, and a second phase of the Responsible Computing
          Challenge, as well as myriad fellowship and grant-making cycles. Bob helps
          Mozilla fellows and awardees become stronger community organizers and
          leaders; and grows the diversity and geographical scope across our
          programs, with an emphasis on expanding our work outside North America.
          Bob serves as the executive producer for both MozFest and of the
          award-winning podcast, IRL</p>
