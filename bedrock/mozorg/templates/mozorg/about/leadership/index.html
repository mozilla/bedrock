      <p>Mitchell Baker co-founded the Mozilla Project to support the open, innovative
        web and ensure it continues offering opportunities for everyone. As CEO of
        Mozilla Corporation, Mitchell is focused on accelerating the growth levers
        for the core Firefox browser product and platform, while investing in
        innovative solutions to mitigate the biggest challenges facing the internet.
      </p>

      <p>As Chairwoman of Mozilla for the last two decades, Mitchell Baker has been
        responsible for organizing and motivating a massive, worldwide, collective
        of employees and volunteers who are building the internet as a global public
        resource, open and accessible to all. Mitchell is deeply engaged in developing
        product offerings that promote the mission of empowering individuals. She
        also guides the overall scope and direction of Mozilla’s mission. Mitchell
        has written the key documents that set out Mozilla's enduring mission and
        commitments — the Mozilla Public License in 1998, the Mozilla Manifesto in
        2007 and the Mozilla Manifesto Addendum — also known as the Pledge for a
        Healthy Internet — in 2018.
      </p>

      <p>Mitchell is a strong advocate for the open internet, open source, and the
        importance of connecting technology to its impact on individuals and society.
        She is highly regarded as one of the pioneers of the web and bringing the
        open internet to consumers. She was instrumental in Netscape’s decision in
        1998 to release its source code to the public. This later led to the release
        of the Firefox browser and the creation of the Mozilla Foundation as a global
        technology force that spans software product development, educational
        initiatives, and participatory movements. After co-founding the Mozilla
        Project, Mitchell served as its general manager and CEO from 1999 until
        January 2008, when the organization’s rapid growth encouraged her to split
        her responsibilities and add a CEO.
      </p>

      <p>Mitchell is a member of the Advisory Boards of the Oxford Internet Institute
        and the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. She is a Board Member of
        OpenMRS, Inc., which develops open source medical records systems for use
        in resource-constrained environments. She co-chaired the U.S. Department
        of Commerce Digital Economy Board of Advisors from its inception in March
        2016 until August 2017, served on the United Nations High Level Panel on
        Women’s Economic Empowerment, and the ICANN High Level Panel on Global
        Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms. A native of the San Francisco
        Bay Area, Mitchell received her B.A. in Asian Studies from UC Berkeley and
        her J.D. from Berkeley Law.
      </p>

      <p><em>TIME Magazine profiled Mitchell in its global list of “100 Most Influential
        People” under “Scientists and Thinkers”. Bloomberg listed her as one of the
        “25 Most Influential People on the Web”. She was honored as winner of the
        Anita Borg Institute’s 2009 Women of Vision Award and received the Aenne
        Burda Award for Creative Leadership in 2010. In 2012, Mitchell was inducted
        into the founding group of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/mitchell-baker">Internet Society’s Hall of Fame</a>.
        In 2018 she received the Webby Lifetime Achievement Award. She also received
        an honorary doctorate from the Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium.
        She has written op-eds for the Atlantic and CNN.com and appeared on NBC
        “Meet the Press”, BBC “HardTalk”, “CNN Global Office” , NBC’s “Weekend Today”,
        France 24, the UK's Channel 4 and NPR’s “Morning Edition". She has spoken
        at high-level events like Tech for Good, VivaTech, Wired NextFest, World
        Economic Forum, Mobile World Congress, Web Summit, Collision and
        Singularity University.</em>
