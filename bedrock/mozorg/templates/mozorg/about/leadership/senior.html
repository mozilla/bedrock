        Having an independent implementation of the web platform as a part of
        Firefox is important to Mozilla’s mission and vision of an open and
        accessible internet. Andrew and his team maintain solid working
        relationships with their colleagues across the industry and productively
        collaborate via standards bodies such as the IETF and the W3C.

        Andrew joined Mozilla in May of 2012 after having spent a decade working
        at Red Hat. He was a member of a variety of open source communities and
        enjoyed his time as a member of the Eclipse Architecture Council. He holds
        a BASc in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto.

        Security (TLS), the foundational security protocol for the Web. He is the
        former chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force TLS Working group as
        well as the editor of the TLS and HTTPS specification. Eric co-designed
        Datagram Transport Layer Security, and is the author of one of the standard
        books on TLS.</p>
