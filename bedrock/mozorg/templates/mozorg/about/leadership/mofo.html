      <p>J. Bob Alotta is a veteran movement builder and executive working at the
        intersection of technology and communities.</p>

      <p>Prior to joining Mozilla, Bob led the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice,
        a global foundation based in New York City that provides critical resources
        to LGBTQI+ activists and artists around the world. Over eight years, they
        quintupled the global footprint of the organization which makes more grants
        in the global majority than any other funder in their sector. Bob specifically
        strengthened movements by adding extra support for digital security, data
        use, and internet freedom to otherwise “non-tech” grants. As chair of the
        Global Philanthropy Project, Bob helped secure the largest bilateral and
        multilateral investments to date for LGBTQI+ communities worldwide. Bob
        was an early architect of the “feminist internet” and the creator of
        CommsLabs, bringing queer human rights defenders and technologists together.
        Bob builds bridges between the LGBTQI+ and digital rights worlds.</p>

      <p>Now serving as Senior Vice President of Global Programs at Mozilla
        Foundation, Bob brings their experience as a movement strategist to leverage
        the organizations’ programs to shift power back to people instead of “big”
        tech. Through the lens of trustworthy AI, Bob has launched the African
        Innovation Mradi, the Data Futures Lab, the Mozilla Technology Fund, the
        Creative Media Awards, and a second phase of the Responsible Computing
        Challenge, as well as myriad fellowship and grant-making cycles. Bob helps
        Mozilla fellows and awardees become stronger community organizers and
        leaders; and grows the diversity and geographical scope across our
        programs, with an emphasis on expanding our work outside North America.
        Bob serves as the executive producer for both MozFest and of the
        award-winning podcast, IRL</p>
