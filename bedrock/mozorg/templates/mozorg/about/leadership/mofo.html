      <p>The internet is one of our most valuable public resources -- it’s Mark
        Surman’s job to keep it healthy.</p>

      <p>Mark is Executive Director of Mozilla Foundation, the global nonprofit that
        does everything from making Firefox to standing up for issues like online

        founding Director of telecentre.org, a $26M initiative connecting community
        technology centers in more than 30 countries. He ran the Commons Group for

        networks, open source and social enterprise to nonprofits and governments
        around the world. Mark was awarded the prestigious Shuttleworth Fellowship,
        where he explored how to apply open source approaches to philanthropy in
        the year before he joined Mozilla.</p>

      <p>Mark is a prominent thinker and thought leader — his analysis and opinions
        have been featured in <cite>The Washington Post</cite>, NPR, CNN, the BBC,

    <div class="person-bio">
      <p>J. Bob Alotta is a veteran movement builder and nonprofit executive working
        at the intersection of technology and communities.</p>

      <p>Prior to joining Mozilla, Bob led the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice,
        a global foundation based in New York City that provides critical resources
        to LGBTQI+ organizations and individuals around the world. Over eight years,
        Bob quintupled the global footprint of the organization which makes more
        grants in the global south and east than any other funder in their sector.
        She built a funding program aimed specifically at strengthening movements
        by adding extra support for digital security, data use, and internet freedom
        to otherwise “non-tech” grants. Bob worked with major funders to bring
        money into Astraea — and to influence what else these funders invested in
        worldwide. And, Bob built bridges between the LGBTQI+ and digital rights
        worlds.</p>

      <p>It was through this last bit of work that Bob met Mozilla: At MozFest and
        as a Mozilla fellowship host organization. Now serving as Vice President,
        Global Programs at Mozilla Foundation, Bob brings their experience both
        building movements, and building bridges across movements. Bob works with
        allies across the movement to develop clear goals and real momentum on
        issues like trustworthy AI; helps Mozilla fellows and awardees become
        stronger community organizers and leaders; and grows the diversity and
        geographical scope across our programs, with an emphasis on expanding our
        work outside North America.</p>
