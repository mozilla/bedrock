<h2 id="support-policy">Support Newsgroups Cancellation Policy (mozilla.support.*)</h2>

  <p>The support newsgroups are monitored by the support newsgroup moderator and his assistants (if any).</p>

  <dl class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <dt>Uncivil Posts</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The first rule of the <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.forums.etiquette') }}">etiquette guidelines</a> is to be civil.
          If they agree that a post contains a personal attack, they will immediately remove the post and (if possible) notify the poster by private e-mail.</p>
     </dd>

    <dt>Off-Topic Posts and Other Etiquette Violations</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        If they agree that someone is regularly off-topic or repeatedly violates the <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.forums.etiquette') }}">etiquette guidelines</a> in other ways, they will warn them by private e-mail (or in the newsgroup if the e-mail address cannot be determined).
        If they later agree that the behaviour has not changed, they will notify the person by e-mail (or newsgroup post, as above) and then start to cancel any and all infringing posts from that person, without warning or comment.
        </p>

        <p>At least the first time round, an e-mailed assurance of reformation, plus a practical demonstration of one month in length (where the group feels the need to cancel no or very few posts), resets the process.</p>
      </dd>
  </dl>

<h2 id="other-policy">Other Newsgroups Cancellation Policy</h2>

<p>Currently, no non-spam messages are cancelled in other Mozilla newsgroups.</p>
