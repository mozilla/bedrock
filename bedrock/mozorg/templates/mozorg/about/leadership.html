            Mitchell Baker co-founded the Mozilla Project to support the open, innovative web and ensure it continues offering opportunities for everyone. As CEO of Mozilla Corporation, Mitchell is focused on accelerating the growth levers for the core Firefox browser product and platform, while investing in innovative solutions to mitigate the biggest challenges facing the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Chairwoman of Mozilla for the last two decades, Mitchell Baker has been responsible for organizing and motivating a massive, worldwide, collective of employees and volunteers who are building the internet as a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Mitchell is deeply engaged in developing product offerings that promote the mission of empowering individuals. She also guides the overall scope and direction of Mozilla’s mission. Mitchell has written the key documents that set out Mozilla's enduring mission and commitments -- the Mozilla Public License in 1998, the Mozilla Manifesto in 2007 and the Mozilla Manifesto Addendum -- also known as the Pledge for a Healthy Internet -- in 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mitchell is a strong advocate for the open internet, open source, and the importance of connecting technology to its impact on individuals and society. She is highly regarded as one of the pioneers of the web and bringing the open internet to consumers. She was instrumental in Netscape’s decision in 1998 to release its source code to the public. This later led to the release of the Firefox browser and the creation of the Mozilla Foundation as a global technology force that spans software product development, educational initiatives, and participatory movements. After co-founding the Mozilla Project, Mitchell served as its general manager and CEO from 1999 until January 2008, when the organization’s rapid growth encouraged her to split her responsibilities and add a CEO.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mitchell is a member of the Advisory Boards of the Oxford Internet Institute and the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. She is a Board Member of OpenMRS, Inc., which develops open source medical records systems for use in resource-constrained environments. She co-chaired the U.S. Department of Commerce Digital Economy Board of Advisors from its inception in March 2016 until August 2017, served on the United Nations High Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment, and the ICANN High Level Panel on Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms. A native of the San Francisco Bay Area, Mitchell received her B.A. in Asian Studies from UC Berkeley and her J.D. from Berkeley Law.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              TIME Magazine profiled Mitchell in its global list of “100 Most Influential People” under “Scientists and Thinkers”. Bloomberg listed her as one of the “25 Most Influential People on the Web”. She was honored as winner of the Anita Borg Institute’s 2009 Women of Vision Award and received the Aenne Burda Award for Creative Leadership in 2010. In 2012, Mitchell was inducted into the founding group of the <a rel="external" href="http://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/mitchell-baker">Internet Society’s Hall of Fame</a>. In 2018 she received the Webby Lifetime Achievement Award. She also received an honorary doctorate from the Universite Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. She has written op-eds for the Atlantic and CNN.com and appeared on NBC “Meet the Press”, BBC “HardTalk”, “CNN Global Office” , NBC’s “Weekend Today”, France 24, the UK's Channel 4 and NPR’s “Morning Edition". She has spoken at high-level events like Tech for Good, VivaTech, Wired NextFest, World Economic Forum, Mobile World Congress, Web Summit, Collision and Singularity University.

            J. Bob Alotta is a veteran movement builder and nonprofit executive working at the intersection of technology and communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to joining Mozilla, Bob led the Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, a global foundation based in New York City that provides critical resources to LGBTQI+ organizations and individuals around the world. Over eight years, Bob quintupled the global footprint of the organization which makes more grants in the global south and east than any other funder in their sector. She built a funding program aimed specifically at strengthening movements by adding extra support for digital security, data use, and internet freedom to otherwise “non-tech” grants. Bob worked with major funders to bring money into Astraea -- and to influence what else these funders invested in worldwide. And, Bob built bridges between the LGBTQI+ and digital rights worlds.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was through this last bit of work that Bob met Mozilla: At MozFest and as a Mozilla fellowship host organization. Now serving as Vice President, Global Programs at Mozilla Foundation, Bob brings their experience both building movements, and building bridges across movements. Bob works with allies across the movement to develop clear goals and real momentum on issues like trustworthy AI; helps Mozilla fellows and awardees become stronger community organizers and leaders; and grows the diversity and geographical scope across our programs, with an emphasis on expanding our work outside North America.
