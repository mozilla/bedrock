            Mitchell Baker co-founded the Mozilla Project to support the open and innovative web and to ensure it continues offering opportunities for everyone. As Executive Chairwoman of Mozilla, Mitchell Baker is responsible for organizing and motivating a massive, worldwide, collective of employees and volunteers around the world who are building the Internet as a global public resource, open and accessible to all.

            Mitchell is a strong advocate for the open web and open source, and is highly regarded as one of the pioneers who have built the web as it is today. She was instrumental in Netscape’s decision in 1998 to release its source code to the public. This later led to the release of the Firefox browser and the creation of the Mozilla Project as one of the most influential technology organizations in the world, spanning software product development, educational initiatives, and participatory movements. After co-founding the Mozilla Project, Mitchell served as its general manager and CEO from 1999 until January 2008, when the organization’s rapid growth encouraged her to split her responsibilities and add a CEO.

Over the last three years she hired 900 people, opened offices in seven countries, integrated acquisitions and built all the HR competencies necessary to meet the challenges of its IPO.
