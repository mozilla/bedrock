            Mitchell is a strong advocate for the open web and open source, and is highly regarded as one of the pioneers who have built the web as it is today. She was instrumental in Netscape’s decision in 1998 to release its source code to the public.

After co-founding the Mozilla Project, Mitchell served as its general manager and CEO from 1999 until January 2008, when the organization’s rapid growth encouraged her to split her responsibilities and add a CEO.
