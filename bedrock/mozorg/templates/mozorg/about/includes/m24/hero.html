    <p>Mozilla is an activist organization working to put control of the internet back in the hands of the people using it.</p>
    <p><strong>We advocate</strong> for better products, holding governments and tech corporations accountable for what they create. We monitor developments, conduct research, and campaign to improve products and drive policies that will represent your interests.</p>
    <p><strong>We build</strong> products that put you in control. Like Firefox, Fakespot and more.</p>
    <p><strong>We fund</strong> and invest in the people and efforts taking technology, the internet, and AI in the right direction.</p>
    <p>Together, we can keep the internet easy, safe and free, for everyone.</p>
