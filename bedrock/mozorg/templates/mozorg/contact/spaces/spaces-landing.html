      <h2>Mozilla Spaces</h2>
      <p>
        Mozilla Spaces are our offices around the world. They are open environments
        where Mozillians can work side by side â€” hacking, coding, designing,
        researching and creating. They are places for us to meet, collaborate and
        continue to building a brighter future for the Web.
