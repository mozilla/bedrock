"""
We need this command because we need to clear out the entire
database during a deployment of the demo servers, but we
can't drop the whole DB and recreate because our user doesn't
have the permission, and we don't want it to have permission.

It needs to do it this way because we need it to delete all
tables regardless of whether they're modeled in the currently
deployed code.
