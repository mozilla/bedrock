  <div class="section-content">
    <h3>Firefox OS is a catalyst for individual and collective progress</h3>
    <p>We have always fought to keep the Web open so innovation and creativity can flourish.</p>
    <p>Because we believe that each and every one of us has the right to information and inspiration that will expand our perspectives, increase our abilities and maximize our impact. We believe life is too short to live inside someone else’s walls. And we believe the more we’re connected, the further we can go.</p>
    <p>But for the Internet to live up to its potential, everyone needs access. Now with Firefox OS, we’re making it possible for more people to take advantage of the full power of the Web — giving you the freedom to blaze your own path, amplify your voice, control your destiny, transform the future.</p>
