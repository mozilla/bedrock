  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <div><img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/identity/firefox/usage-standard.png?2013-06') }}" alt="Usage Standard" id="usage-standard" /></div>
  <p>Our standard lockup. Outside of a few exceptions, this is the default, go-to, everybody’s- happy version. (In other words, when in doubt, use this.)</p>
  <div><img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/identity/firefox/usage-logo.png?2013-06') }}" alt="Usage Logo" id="usage-logo" /></div>
  <p>The logo alone. Use this only when Mozilla and Firefox are clearly visible or have been well established elsewhere on the page or in the design. (When in doubt, use the other one.)</p>
  <div class="clear"><img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/identity/firefox/usage-standard-alt.png?2013-06') }}" alt="Usage Standard Alt" id="usage-standard-alt" /></div>
  <p>Alternate lockup. Use this on posters, banners or when horizontal space is an issue. Unlike the standard horizontal lockup, do not use this with any of the channel logos or wordmarks.</p>

<section id="mistakes">
  <div id="mistakes-intro">
    <h2>Common mistakes</h2>
    <p>Think of these as the equivalent of wearing your shoes on the wrong feet: they’re still shoes, they’re basically where they’re supposed to be, but it just feels wrong.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="what-to-look-for">
    <img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/box-arrow.png?2013-06') }}" alt="" class="box-arrow" />
    <div>
      <h4>What to look for</h4>
      <p>To avoid a faux-pas — or "faux-paw," as the case may be — please note the differences in tail and globe detail between past logos and our most recent version.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="caption-1">The new globe has high gloss removed, softer deeper gradients for better contrast and new higher detail continents.</p>
    <p class="caption-2">The fox fur is now a softer gradient orange and has much less detail (he also has a proper shoulder).</p>
    <p class="caption-3">The tail still wraps around the globe, which peeks through in some places, but there is much less detail and there are more high contrast yellow/white flames.</p>

<section id="partner">
  <div id="partner-intro">
    <h2>Partner co-branding</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we team up with partners. This is how you can make our logo play nice with others (as long as you have all the necessary permissions, of course).</p>
  </div>
  <div id="partner-standard">
    <img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/identity/firefox/partner-standard.png?2013-06') }}" alt="Standard edition" id="partner-standard-image" />
    <h4>Standard edition</h4>
    <p>For use in co-promotional campaigns and ads, joint announcements or press releases.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="partner-distribution-partner">
    <img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/identity/firefox/partner-distribution-partner.png?2013-06') }}" alt="Distribution deal — partner edition" id="partner-distribution-partner-image" />
    <h4>Distribution deal — partner edition</h4>
    <p>Use when one of our partners offers a custom Firefox build for download on their site.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="partner-distribution-standard">
    <img src="{{ media('/img/styleguide/identity/firefox/partner-distribution-standard.png?2013-06') }}" alt="Distribution deal — standard edition" id="partner-distribution-standard-image" />
    <h4>Distribution deal — standard edition</h4>
    <p>Use when one of our partners offers an official Firefox build for download on their site, but still wants their brand associated with it.</p>
