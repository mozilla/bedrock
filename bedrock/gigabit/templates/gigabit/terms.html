          Mozilla Foundation (“Mozilla” or “Sponsor”) is a global non-profit organization with a mission to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web. With support from the United States National Science Foundation (“NSF”), Mozilla presents this Gigabit Community Fund (the “Fund”) to help foster and support the development of applications and associated curricula running on next-generation networks that could improve people’s everyday lives through creating new education and workforce development opportunities. Proposals submitted to the Gigabit Community Fund may be based on projects funded in the separate Mozilla Ignite Challenge conducted prior to this Gigabit Community Fund, building off existing ideas and funding, or may be based entirely on new ideas (“Submissions”).
