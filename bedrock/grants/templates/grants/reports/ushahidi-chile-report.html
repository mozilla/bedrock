<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On February 27, 2010, at 03:34 local time a tremendous earthquake occurred
off the coast of the Maule Region of Chile, rating a magnitude of 8.8 on the
Richter scale and lasting 90 seconds. The earthquake was felt in six regions in
Chile, affecting 80 percent of the country's population. The cities
experiencing the strongest shaking on the Mercalli intensity scale were Arauco
and Coronel.</p>

<p>The earthquake also generated a blackout that affected 93 percent of the
country's population and which lasted several days in some locations. President
Michelle Bachelet declared a "state of catastrophe" and sent military troops to
take control of the most affected areas. The death toll as of May 15, 2010 is
521 victims (down from early reports on March 3 of 802). Seismologists estimate
that the earthquake was so powerful that it may have shortened the length of
the day by 1.26 microseconds and moved the Earth's figure axis by 8 cm or 2.7
milliarcseconds. It is estimated that Chile's territory could have expanded 1.2
km<sup>2</sup> as a result.</p>

<p>An aftershock of 6.2 was recorded 20 minutes after the initial quake. Two
more aftershocks of magnitudes 5.4 and 5.6 followed within an hour of the
initial quake. By March 6 UTC, more than 130 aftershocks had been registered,
including thirteen above magnitude 6.0.</p>

<p>Just a month an a half before a catastrophic earthquake of magnitude 7.0 Mw
was felt approximately 25 km (16 miles) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's
capital. The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time on Tuesday, 12 January
2010. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake; the Haitian
Government reported that an estimated 230,000 people had died, 300,000 had been
injured and 1,000,000 made homeless.</p>

<p>In that occasion Patrick Meier and David Kobia from Ushahidi inc. created
the Ushahidi-Haiti deployment within two hours after the earthquake. On January
16, 2010, Ushahidi partners launched the 4636 SMS short code in Haiti allowing
free mobile reporting of emergency needs and offers of help with location
information via a text message. To help with the near real-time crisis mapping
efforts Patrick Meier mobilized over 300 student volunteers from Tufts
University and beyond manage the Ushahidi platform for Haiti.</p>

<p>The project expanded to involve several thousand Haitian volunteers to
crowd-source the translation of SMS messages and other crisis reports from
Creole to English as well as determine specific location information in Haiti.
By January 19, 2010, Ushahidi-Haiti became an important resource for near
real-time, geo-tagged crisis information used by the US Coast Guard and Joint
Task Force Command Center, the Red Cross, the UN Foundation, US State
Department, International Medical Corps, the Clinton Foundation, and other
first responder organizations.</p>

<h2>Ushahidi-Chile</h2>

<p>When the 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck Chile on the morning of February
27, 2010, Patrick Meier and David Kobia launched a copy of the Ushahidi-Haiti
platform for Chile. That afternoon, Patrick Meier invited students from
Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) to
collaborate. Just 48 hours after that, the Ushahidi-Chile instance was launched
and the SIPA Ushahidi Situation Room was setup at Colombia University.</p>

<p>On the eve of March 1, 2010, the group started working on the platform with
more than 60 SIPA student volunteers trained by Digital Democracy to monitor
social and traditional media reports from Chile. On the first day, the
volunteers manually mapped over 100 incidents. In two days, Ushahidi-Chile had
over 150 volunteers and in three days they had over 700 reports mapped. To this
date, Ushahidi-Chile volunteers have manually mapped nearly 1,200 reports.A
Situation Room open from 9am to 9pm was set up in the School of International
and Public Affairs, in Lehman Library, where food and beverage was available
for students volunteering thanks to the Grant given by Mozilla Corporation.</p>

<p>At first the Chile deployment only collected information from media sources.
A week after deployment, Patrick Meier put the team in touch with the local
organization Chile Ayuda, which established two numbers for the platform to
collect information directly from the people in Chile via text message. It took
about three weeks to set up the numbers for information collection.</p>

<p>At the same time, a journalist from Internews Network working in Chile
contacted the Ushahidi team and began collaborating to put the team in contact
with relevant local partners. It was through this connection that the team made
contact with Radio Bio Bio and with governmental representative in the new
elected Chilean Government.</p>

<p>The Radio station started broadcasting the number for text message reports
three weeks later and set up an information box on the their website. In April,
SIPA started working with the Ministry of Education to monitor the number of
Chilean students attending school.</p>

<p>In order to manage the increased number of reports coming in from media
outlets, partner organizations, and text message, the Ushahidi team back in New York organized increased their mobilization of volunteers. They organized
training sessions, and ended up training of 198 people on how to use the
platform. The training involved UNDP and UNICEF personnel in New York City,
students form the Mailman School of Public Health, undergrad students from
Columbia University, students from New York University and volunteers working
remotely from different parts of the US.In April and May, four students were
able to travel to Chile using the money of the Mozilla grant to contact
organizations working in the field and eventually transfer ownership of the
Ushahidi Chile platform to local control. The Ushahidi team members also held
trainings for university students and raised awareness on the possible uses of
the Ushahidi Platform.</p>
</div>

<div id="objectives">
<h2>Objectives and Goals</h2>

<p>Ushahidi-Chile at SIPA requested funding to Mozilla Corporation to be able
continue immediate volunteer efforts, raise awareness of the platform, and
enable students to travel to Chile to work with organizations and universities
to transfer ownership of the platform.</p>

<p>The goal was to continue working with Chileans to update the Ushahidi page
so that it will be of use in the next stages of reconstruction in southern
Chile. By supporting SIPA volunteers who were currently working with the
Ushahidi Platform, the funding was requested to be able to ultimately empower
Chileans to use innovative technology as they started the process of
reconstruction in the communities affected by the earthquake.</p>

<p>The funding needs and measurable goals were divided into the short, medium
and long term for the project.</p>

<p>The short-term goal was to improve the capacity to provide emergency support
to Chile at the Columbia University level. The SIPA team needed funding to
promote the initiative and hold training sessions for volunteers so that
reports on needs and responses in Chile could continue to be mapped. The goal
was to increase the core volunteer team from the current 10 students to 30
dedicated volunteers, and consistently mapping of at least 100 incidents per
day through the end of March.</p>

<p>The medium-term goal was to promote the development of Ushahidi as a public
resource by transferring ownership to an established Chilean group, or a newly
formed association of individuals. The SIPA team wanted to continue building
on contacts with the Chilean health ministry, IT students in Talca and
nonprofit organizations like Un Techo Para Chile and Chile Ayuda in order to
identify stakeholders that could take over administration of the Ushahidi
platform. The SIPA team also wanted to identify a core group in Chile that
had the capacity to scale the project, adapt the platform, and create a clear
vision about how the tool could be adapted to their own local needs.</p>

<p>Two students traveled to Chile for 10 days in April to hold initial focus
groups with the new group of Ushahidi Chile administrators, hold crisis mapping
training sessions at Chilean universities, and establish connections with local
Mozilla officers who could help the Chilean team adapt the Ushahidi platform
for their own local needs. The trip was aimed also at promoting awareness of
the Ushahidi platform in Chile.</p>

<p>A second team of two students returned in Chile in May to follow up on the
work done in April. The second team met with many of the partner organizations
originally contacted in April to further their involvement with the Ushahidi
platform. The second team also met with new potential partners and continued to
raise awareness of other possible applications of Ushahidi in Chile.</p>

<p>The final goal was to adapt the Ushahidi platform's categories from
displaying disaster response to indicators showing longer-term development
themes, as identified by the Chilean team with the SIPA team's support. Upon
returning from Chile, the SIPA team wanted to continue monitoring the Ushahidi
page, looking for a 20 percent increase in the number of incidents reported by
Chileans as well as increased usage of the website and platform in rural areas,
especially those affected by the earthquake.</p>

<p>The SIPA team's long-term goal was to build a crisis mapping toolkit that
would be shared with new colleagues in Chile, so that Columbia University
students and the new Chilean group have the knowledge and resources to quickly
implement a Ushahidi platform in different contexts in the future.
Achievement of this goal was going to be measured by delivering web and
paper-based toolkit materials.</p>
</div>

<div id="impact">
<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation's grant supported both the SIPA students' efforts in
monitoring and mapping reports from New York and facilitating valuable meetings
amongst Ushahidi-users in Chile. Through these venues, the Ushahidi-Chile at
SIPA was able to contribute to the following impact.</p>

<p><b>1215 reports mapped</b></p>

<p>Through the efforts of SIPA students monitoring media resources and mapping
GPS coordinates and verifying reports, a total of 1215 earthquake related
reports have been mapped. It is noteworthy that within the first 4 days, 700
reports were done. These reports updated the local Chileans about the situation
of collapsed buildings, available food drives, and dangerous looting areas.</p>

<p><b>Over 100 students trained</b></p>

<p>Within days, during midterm exams, the Ushahidi-Chile team was able to train
over 100 SIPA students how to monitor, map, and administer the Ushahidi
platform. Many of these students were vital in keeping the map up to date and
helping Chileans on the ground. These students are now equipped with the most
innovative, technological crisis mapping tool that will be useful in many
ways.</p>

<p><b>Documentation and Training material</b></p>

<p>For the purpose of advertising the platform and the activities of the
Ushahidi-Chile project at SIPA to the Chilean organizations and to
International organization potentially interested in taking part in the
project, the team has produced a leaflet to be distributes via e-mail and
printed copy in Chile and elsewhere. In addition to that Ushaidi-Chile@SIPA
created a comprehensive guide on the use and the management of the platform, in
English and in Spanish, to be given to the Universities and the organizations
trained in Chile.</p>

<p><b>Connecting with 8 Chilean Organizations</b></p>

<p>Through the two trips to Chile funded by the Mozilla Foundation,
Ushahidi-Chile was able to connect with 8 different organizations on the ground
plus 4 Univerisities. Furthermore, Ushahidi-Chile served as connectors and
facilitators of these individual organizations that were already involved with
or interested in Ushahidi to match their goals and leverage their skills.</p>

<p><b>Water experiment with Radio Bio-Bio</b></p>

<p>Ushahidi-Chile partnered with Radio Bio-Bio and conducted several
experiments to analyze the availability of potable water. Over the local radio,
they ran scheduled announcements that called for Chileans to call in to
indicate whether their home address has drinkable water or not. These
experiments proved that weeks after the earthquake, the majority of the
households in the broadcast region still did not have access to water.</p>

<p><b>School Attendance experiment with Ministry of Education</b></p>

<p>In remote areas of Chile, the only way to communicate to the family that a
school has reopened could be through a poster on the bulletin board. Since this
board could be miles away from the students' homes, many students will miss
the chance to return to school without even knowing about it. To address this
problem, the Ministry of Education approached Ushahidi Chile to conduct a SMS
experiment that will survey which students will be attending school. The
purpose of the experiment was to take a bottom-up approach to find out how many
students in each of the experiment districts would be able to return to school
on opening day.</p>

<p><b>Institutionalizing Crisis-Mapping at SIPA</b></p>

<p>The Ushahidi-Chile initiative at SIPA gave birth to a new student group, the
New Media Task Force, that will focus on institutionalizing Crisis-Mapping at
SIPA. With or without an emergency, a group of SIPA students will always be
trained and ready to deploy an Ushahidi platform. Having this trained group of
students will cut down on organization and mobilization time in the event of a
future emergency.</p>

<p>Organized and certified training programs will be available and since SIPA
has already gained reputation in the field as successful crisis mappers, it
will help in training other schools around the world. The Ushahidi-Chile
initiative has left a lasting impact in the realm of graduate schools in that
students are now able to help in a meaningful and tangible way during a
disaster.</p>

<p><b>Crisis Mapping as a recognized Developing Tool</b></p>

<p>The efforts at SIPA has been recognized by numerous international networks
such as BBC, Al Jazeera, Newsweek and New York Times. Combined with efforts
done for Haiti, the international aid and government agencies have accepted
that Ushahidi is a legitimate, powerful tool for humanitarian relief. Hilary
Clinton said "The technology community has set up interactive maps to help us
identify needs and target resources." This initiative was one of the first
times an online map made an impact for disaster relief, and it is likely many
will follow.</p>
</div>

<div id="lessons">
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>There were only a few hours between the moment the earthquake struck Chile
to the first student-volunteer who browsed through media to find reports of
needs and responses. The project wasn't planned and there was no
infrastructure in place at the start of the deployment. For this reason, the
Ushahidi management team was forced to develop solutions to problems in real
time and act on decisions in the moment. Through the process of enacting plans
and learning from mistakes, the team took away many lessons about deploying an
emergency response effort that may be useful to future Ushahidi deployments.
This section summarizes the key lessons that were learned from the Chile
deployment that could be applied to other Ushahidi projects.</p>

<p><b>Training</b></p>

<p>Although there were numerous training sessions held throughout the project
duration, we found that most volunteers learned the most by actually doing
crisis mapping. Initially, there was a high demand and dependency for core
management members to be working in the situation room around the clock to
guide new volunteers through the mapping process. To alleviate demand on the
core management team, we found that it was beneficial to train some dedicated
volunteers to be trainers themselves. This community approach to training
increased the number of people who could train new members and enabled
dedicated volunteers to play more of a leadership role in the project. It was
important to have clear instructions to pass on to volunteers and trainers, so
we learned to keep logs, notes, and indices at the Situation Room that were
available to all volunteers and kept the whole team on the same page. We found
that was important to develop training materials and references could be shared
by all volunteers. These standardized materials were developed in English and
could be modified to use with other projects.</p>

<p><b>Process Flow</b></p>

<p>Through the process of trial and error, we learned the best way to break
down the process flow was to create three roles for volunteers: Media monitors,
mappers, and admin. This division of labor is effective when there is a high
volume of reports to be monitored, mapped, and approved. The problem
encountered with this division of labor was that there was an overlap of
information and there needed to be clear and cohesive instructions amongst the
three roles. The creation of wiki, google forms, and spreadsheets aided with
this process. For the future, utilizing SwiftRiver will be helpful because it
will cluster and geo-locate the monitored reports automatically.</p>

<p><b>Closing the Feedback Loop</b></p>

<p>It is a constant struggle for the Ushahidi platform to close the feedback
loop, and indicate which needs identified by Ushahidi have been acted on.
Chileans knew about the existence of the Ushahidi platform within two days of
the earthquake, however, the volunteers in New York were had no way of knowing
who was using the site in Chile. This was a huge challenge for student
volunteers, as we did not know which reports, if any, were actually making a
difference in the recovery process. Volunteers in the Chile deployment had
knowledge of how Ushahidi was used in Haiti, and during the initial phase of
the Chile project the volunteers had to act on faith that the Chile project
would serve a similar purpose. It wasn't until we reported a significant
number of incidents that we started to receive feedback from people on the
ground and establish partnerships with local organizations. Closing this
feedback loop sooner would increase the utility of Ushahidi and increase its
draw to volunteers. For future projects, it will be helpful to connect new
volunteers with past volunteers who have experienced the tangible difference
Ushahidi is making. This is also true from the opposite end, as it is
important to notify that those who are sending these messages by SMS know that
their messages are being reported. It is important to create a two-way system
to ensure that their cry for help is not being ignored.</p>

<p><b>Volunteer Motivation</b></p>

<p>It was a constant struggle to recruit and motivate volunteers to monitor and
map reports. It was to our disadvantage that there was less of an emotional
impact for Chile as it was in Haiti. Because it was less obvious that the
volunteers were making a difference, the number of volunteers dwindled after
the first two weeks of operation. Ushahidi-Chile learned that having the basic
nourishments (food, snacks, drinks) is important to recruit volunteers,
especially student volunteers. The Mozilla Grant helped the management team
provide these refreshments for our volunteers. Additionally, having an actual
Situation Room is critical to motivate volunteers. Although students can
volunteer remotely, it is more cooperative and inspiring if there is a team of
mappers and monitors with which volunteers can actually interact. Also, having
the Situation Room be visible to the larger crowd is successful in inviting
random students to stop by and entice them to volunteer. Additionally, not
knowing how many reports to expect also made volunteer recruitment and planning
difficult. There were a few instances where we were recruited many volunteers
to help with what we expected to be a large number of incoming SMS reports, but
none arrived even when the volunteers were ready. These instances taught us
that the timing to recruit volunteers are important, and that we should only
motivate volunteers only after verifying that there is an actual need.</p>

<p><b>Technical Difficulties</b></p>

<p>The technical aspect of Ushahidi is extremely difficult for non-technical
users. Specifically, most volunteers do not have a technical background and
there is high dependency and burden on technically savvy volunteers. There is a
time delay when in fixing technical glitches, which posed challenges for our
operations. For example, in one case, it was unclear when we received SMS from
the senders. There needed to be a more obvious indication of messages being
received, but our team did not possess the in-house knowledge to be able to fix
this issue ourselves. We had to recruit a programmer to fix this. Another
example was that the Ushahidi platform did not support accents in the text,
which caused problems working with Chile, a Spanish speaking country. Also,
the SMS would enter with only half of the phone number visible, which made it
impossible for us to reach out and actually attempt to help the person who
reported the emergency. At times, some technical issues were easy to fix, as
soon as we received some training. For example, adding new categories was an
easy fix. By recruiting more volunteers with technical backgrounds and
increasing the communication flow between the non-technical and technical
volunteers, these problems could be alleviated.</p>

<p><b>Travel</b></p>

<p>Establishing a presence on the ground is critical for a successful
deployment of Ushahidi, as you will meet key stakeholders face to face and
learn about the reality and resources on the ground. Prior to traveling, it is
required that a phone or Skype meeting is done so that all parties are on the
same page when they meet in person. We found that the longer the team is able
to spend on the ground and meet with stakeholders, the more beneficial the trip
will be. This allows the Ushahidi representative to gain a stronger
understanding of the realities on the ground, and establish more meaningful
relationships with partners. For Ushahidi-Chile, it was beneficial to send
representative in two trips as we were able use the second trip to build on
partnerships established during the first.</p>

<p><b>Communication Abroad</b></p>

<p>Effective communication with local partner organizations is key. It is
important to understand that emailing may not work in the same way as it does
in the US, and that having an in-person, face to face meeting is powerful.
Also, it is critical to know the right contact within the organization. For
example, knowing the computer programmer of one organization may not be as
useful than knowing the international volunteer coordinator of the same
organization, and it often takes intimate knowledge of an organization to know
who the right person to speak to is. It is also to important to remember that
one meeting may not enough, and that it takes time to build meaningful and
mutually beneficial partnerships.</p>

<p><b>Local Partnerships</b></p>

<p>Upon traveling to Chile, we learned that many of the organizations were
already using the Ushahidi platform and were excellent Ushahidid users. In
fact, the success of the platform often depends very heavily on these
stakeholder organizations working together. Our most effective role was to
introduce these organizations to each other, connect their goals and strengths,
and facilitate their meetings. It is also helpful to connect local
organizations with local media to increase publicity and recognition. It is
advised to attend related events such as the Global Voice Conference to
increase contacts in the field. Finally, as it is difficult to research local
organizations, it will be beneficial to partner with NGOs.</p>

<p><b>The Role of US-based volunteers</b></p>

<p>It is important to clarify what the role of student volunteers are. Many
partner organizations misconceived the Ushahidi Chile team as a non-profit
organization, aid agency, or salesperson. It is important to indicate what we
are doing and not doing. This identity must be addressed and understood prior
to meeting partner organizations in person.</p>

<p><b>Sustainability</b></p>

<p>Although we traveled to Chile in hopes that the Chileans will be able to use
the Ushahidi platform for long-term uses, we learned that sustainability was
difficult to obtain, especially as the earthquake response moved from emergency
aid to long-term development. The role of Ushahidi in the long term
redevelopment after the earthquake was not as prominent and many of the
organizations using Ushahidi during the initial phases found it difficult to
prioritize Ushahidi during these later phases. These organizations are often
faced with the same volunteer recruitment difficulties that we faced, and will
only prioritize Ushahidi in so far as it advances their own goals. In order for
Ushahidi to be sustainable in the long run, it must support the mission of the
organizations that use it.</p>

<p><b>Documentation</b></p>

<p>It is always difficult to record operations during a crisis, however it is
important to document these things and leave the lessons learned so that later
operations can learn from these experiences. There should be a better mechanism
that forces documentation during all phases of the project, and records changes
in operation or procedure. This can be done by designating specific managers
who work on blogging about the event.</p>
</div>

<div id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The Ushahidi-Chile at SIPA initiative was a student-led initiative that was
truly organic in nature - it was run by students with little background and
guidance in crisis mapping, scrambling and organizing to help as much as
possible to those who are effected in Chile.</p>

<p>The Mozilla Foundation Grant has helped us make our volunteer force stronger
and our Chilean network deeper. The grant helped motivate volunteers to
remain dedicated to the project and keep working. The initiative was able to go
further because four students were able to travel to Chile to understand the
realities on the ground and develop relationships with partner organizations on
the ground. As the chapter of Chile closes for Ushahidi, we understand that this
is not an end to disaster relief and humanitarian aid that will be needed in
the future. For this reason, Ushahidi and Crisis Mapping skills will be
institutionalized at SIPA and other universities. A student group has already
been formed that will specifically be in charge in creating training programs
and certificates for students to be crisis mappers.These students will be at
the forefront of crisis mapping if and when the next disaster hits.
Furthermore, Ushahidi is already brainstorming ways to train more university
students around the globe to create a network of crisis mappers. SIPA students
will take a leading role in this training, as we were one of the first Ushahidi
users. With these technology and tools, students will become key players in
effective humanitarian aid.</p>

<h2>Annex I: Meetings Notes from the 2 field trips to Chile</h2>

<p><b>FIELD TRIP 1</b></p>

<p>From April 1 to 11, two members of the Ushahidi-Chile core management team,
Diana Rodriguez and Sawako Sonoyama traveled to Chile. Their goal for the trip
was to solidify relationships with interested people and organizations. While
there they were to clarify how different organizations are currently using
Ushahidi, identify how they want to use it going forward, provide training as
needed, and determine next steps. They were also going to try to connect
different organizations to align similar interests and strengthen networks.
During their stay, they were able to meet with several groups and
organizations. A summary of each meeting follows.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #1</b><br>
Organization: ChileAyuda<br>
Attendees: Pedro Fuentes, General Director; Fran Varela, Coordinator of
Mapping/SMS/Technology<br>
Date: April 2, 2010</p>

<p>The first meeting was with Pedro Fuentes and Fran Varela. It was clarified
that ChileAyuda and Digitales por Chile are connected: Digitales por Chile is a
network of computer programmers that are aligned with CrisisCommons and
ChileAyuda is one project of Digitales por Chile, and it aims to centralize
information for the earthquake relief efforts. ChileAyuda's Executive Director
is Felipe Baiterman and General Director is Pedro Fuentes. It is a horizontal
organization that has directors taking responsible of various "cells" such
as communication, government relations, non-profit relations, legal, and
technology. Fran Varela is the director of the technology "cell" and
oversees SMS and the map. They expressed their interest in being involved with
Ushahidi.</p>

<p>Pedro Fuentes expressed his perspective on implementing Ushahidi projects
with the government. He explained the difficulty in working with the government
as they have very little follow through. Many projects start but end up being
shelved within the bureaucracy. He warned to be cautious when starting projects
with the government, and to carefully plan the execution of it.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #2</b><br>
Organization: Ministry of Education (MinEduc)<br>
Attendees: Ramon Rodriguez, Advisor to the Minister of Education; Pedro Fuentes
and Francisca Varela<br>
Date: April 3 and 5, 2010</p>

<p>Ramon Rodriguez explained the motivation behind the education project. The
Ministry of Education has done official announcements that schools will re-open
again on April 5; however, there is no confirmation of who got the information
or who will attend the school. Now that the information has ideally been passed
down from a top-down approach, the goal of Ushahidi is to diffuse the
information from bottom up. This is the sandwich theory of relaying
information. The information would be sent from the students or their parents
whether they will attend class next week or not. It is important for students
to attend school by April 23, or else they will lose a whole year of school.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education in cooperation with Ushahidi Chile decided to
issue a press release that will indicate: If you are NOT attending class,
please send a SMS with the name of your community and school. The school names
and community names should be separated by a comma. The press release would go
out to only the eighth region as a test. The Eight region alone has 54
communities and 430,000 students. To prepare for the worst case scenario,
Ushahidi and ChileAyuda estimated 40,000 messages coming in.</p>

<p>Ushahidi and ChileAyuda made technologically adjustments to handle over
thousands of messages coming in to the system. With a third party company,
Intico, it was determined that the system could hold 1000 messages per hour and
8000 messages would be in a queue. Then, a Google account was created to
receive the messages in a RSS feed so that multiple volunteers can look at the
site simultaneously and without duplicating work. Also, an internet application
titled "MinEduc School Finder" was created to expedite the search for GPS
coordinates.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 5, MinEduc indicated the press release would go out in the
morning. Ten volunteers at Columbia University and five volunteers in Santiago
were prepared to map these messages, however, no SMS entered the system. Fran
Varela confirmed that there was not technical problem. Finally on Thursday,
April 8, MinEduc confirmed that the press release went out to all of the media
sources in the 8th region. To this date, the system did not receive a single
message regarding the students' class attendance.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #3</b><br>
Organization: Universidad Catolica<br>
Attendees: Claudio Mourgues, Professor in Construction Engineering and
Management; Pedro Fuentes<br>
Date: April 5, 2010</p>

<p>The meeting covered introduction to Ushahidi and its usages for
crisis-management for Chile's earthquake. The difference between working with
emergency and transitioning to reconstruction was discussed; and that that
platform must be more automated as it shifts to long-term usages for
reconstruction.</p>

<p>Mourgues offered to connect Ushahidi with the Department of Architecture,
Department of Political Science and the Public Safety Department of the
government.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #4</b><br>
Organization: Internews<br>
Attendees: Rodrigo Luengo, Freelance Journalist<br>
Date: April 5, 2010</p>

<p>Jesse Hardman suggested the meeting with Rodrigo Luengo. Luengo was already
very familiar with Ushahidi-Chile due to Hardman's work. He commented on the
MinEduc project that it is strange that the message has not come through; as he
would suspect that students and parents would send these messages.</p>

<p>Luengo offered to connect Ushahidi with Andrea Vial, the Dean of Journalism
at Universidad Alberto Hurtado, his alma mater. Vial had already been contacted
by the management team, however she has been unresponsive. Luengo reminded that
emailing is slow in Chile and that having face-time is extremely important.</p>

<p>Luengo commented on Ushahidi's partnership with RadioBioBio. He believed
it was important to travel to Concepcion to have face time with the radio
station. He believed that the experiment on water with RadioBiobio was a good
project, however the challenge was having the human resources. He understood
why the radio station required timeliness because of cost issues also. He also
explained that the Chileans who are without water in that region would expect
to see the results of the SMS.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #5</b><br>
Organization: ChileMoz<br>
Attendees: Eduardo Escarez<br>
Date: April 6, 2010</p>

<p>Sarah Doherty from Mozilla Corporation connected Ushahidi-Chile to Eduardo
Escarez and ChileMoz. ChileMoz is interested in supporting Ushahidi and its
initiative in reconstruction, and would like to know what kind of role they
could play. They hope to connect with ChileAyuda to explore their
collaboration. They also offered to connect Ushahidi-Chile with university
students in Valparaiso.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #6</b><br>
Organization: DoingIT/Universidad de Talca<br>
Attendees: Juan Pizarro, Hector Rojas, Jorge ? (IT Prof. at Universidad de
Talca), Pedro Fuentes<br>
Date: April 7, 2010</p>

<p>Juan Pizarro and Hector Rojas have a small IT enterprise called DoingIT.
They are all students in their last year working on their theses and are about
to graduate from U. de Talca. They are trying to collaborate more closely with
Universidad de Talca to secure financial and other support (such as server
space) for their Ushahidi-related project. The University is interested in this
project because of their commitment to do something for the recovery of the
region. The project consists of using the Ushahidi Platform to adapt it to the
needs of small municipalities in Talca. The idea is that this will provide
municipalities that have little resources with an organizational tool that they
can use to track what is happening in their communities. There is a small pilot
in the municipality of Santa Cruz currently under way. The information that is
being inputted in this adapted Ushahidi clone is based on survey information
that volunteers have gathered in Santa Cruz. As such map categories reflect the
information gathered in the surveys (e.g. temporary housing built, blanket
availability, food supplies). The goal of the project is to expand this pilot
to other small municipalities with the help of student volunteers and resources
that the University can offer. Ushahidi-Chile offered support and help with
eventual training for the University.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #7</b><br>
Organization: Universidad Alberto Hurtado<br>
Attendees: Fernando Valenzuela, Omar Aguilar, Aldo Mascareno, Cardina Shrona,
Pedro Fuentes<br>
Date: April 8, 2010</p>

<p>The attendees were all members of the Sociology Department. The meeting
started with an overview and explanation of Ushahidi. The attendees had many
questions about how the platform works and its potential uses. Among the
questions they raised were how are results quantified, if the platform had been
used to benefit marginalized or indigenous communities and if it was possible
to add pictures to the map. An interesting idea from Fernando Valenzuela as to
what their contribution could be was to do a research or academic project to
analyze more systematically how Ushahidi was used in Chile and how it has been
used in other instances. They also thought that they could contribute with
volunteer students and connecting Ushahidi-Chile with the Observatorio Social
of the University, which undertakes impact evaluations among other things.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #8</b><br>
Organization: Department of Public Safety<br>
Attendees: Jorge Nazer (Director), Vinko Fodic (Advisor), Pedro Fuentes<br>
Date: April 8, 2010</p>

<p>Jorge Nazer and Vinko Fodic were interested in using Ushahidi to establish a
comprehensive system for public safety that would gather reports from citizens
on a variety of safety issues such as unlocked doors in a community, auto
theft, crime, tracking sexual offenders, etc. Their idea is similar to the
Mapping Atlanta project. Overall, this was a very positive meeting with the
parties involved showing a high level of interest and commitment to implement
the project. Key points involved having the information be private at first for
internal use and the use of volunteers would not be necessary because their
intention is to devote internal human resources to monitor the platform. Pedro
Fuentes, the representative from ChileAyuda has remained as the point person
for this project. He was to have a follow-up meeting to determine how to
proceed and what programming resources would be needed if they wanted to go
ahead with the project.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #9</b><br>
Organization: Firefox Chile<br>
Attendees: Rodrigo Garcia, Pedro Fuentes<br>
Date: April 9, 2010</p>

<p>Upon learning of the status of several of our projects, in particular the
difficulties with the press release from MinEduc, Rodrigo offered to connect us
with a contact at Emol.cl, an online news media source. He considered that
media exposure was extremely important and that the more people knew about
Ushahidi and also the work ChileAyuda is doing the better. Mario Saavedra, the
Press Director at ChileAyuda was in contact with him. Additional follow-up
items could be having this person do an interview of the Ushahidi team.
Unfortunately, this didn't happen for time constrains.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #10</b><br>
Organization: Universidad de la Frontera, CIISOC (Centro de Investigaciones de
la Inclusion Digital y la Sociedad del Conocimiento)-Temuco<br>
Attendees: Sandra Soto Provoste, Esteban Paiva<br>
Date: April 9, 2010</p>

<p>Sandra and Esteban are both colleagues at CIISOC. Esteban is their IT
person and the one who is dealing with the technology nuts and bolts. This
project was originally intended to be mHealth related to earthquake conditions
(tracking epidemiology), however it was changed due to logistical constraints.
As it stands now, the project is focused on a small rural town called Comuna de
Saavedra, in the 9th region, one of the poorest in the country. The goal of the
project is to track psychiatric patients. Because appropriate treatment and
supervision is crucial to the health of these patients, the project aims to
provide more constant monitoring by including more actively family members
instead of relying solely on health workers. Health workers can't always visit
all their patients as regularly as needed due to logistical constraints. By
using mobiles, caretakers (the patient's family members) can report on
treatment adherence and symptoms using SMS. This SMS would feed into the
Ushahidi map to provide health workers in charge of these patients with a
snapshot of how the patient is doing and if the treatment is being followed. If
there are problems, health workers can better target their efforts by seeing
where their presence is most needed. In order to help them implement this
project, we showed them how we have been managing the Ushahidi platform, we
talked about the human resource component that would be needed and some of the
technological components that could be best suited for this initiative.</p>

<p>Some of their questions/requests included: 1) Is it possible for Ushahidi to
write a letter of support for the project? 2) Are there methodologies for
similar projects that they could use as a reference? We have connected them
with Patrick Meier for answers.</p>

<p>Finally, Esteban expressed interest in using Ushahidi for reconstruction
purposes. He was going to go back to his team and survey if there were
resources and interest there. I would recommend following-up with him for a
meeting.</p>

<p><b>FIELD TRIP 2</b></p>

<p>From May 1 to 13, two members of the Ushahidi-Chile core management team,
Caroline Stauffer and Anahi Ayala Iacucci traveled to Chile. Their goal for the
trip was to further establish relationships with interested people and
organizations. While there they were going to finally decide who was going to
be the lead organization on the future management of the Ushahidi Platform,
identify how they wanted to use it going forward, provide training to all the
interested organizations and Universities, and determine the final step for the
transition to Chile. They were also going to try to connect all the different
organizations contacted previously and interested in managing and using the
platform. During their stay, they were able to meet with several groups and
organizations. A summary of each meeting follows.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #1:</b><br>
Organization: Co-Op / Reconstruye<br>
Attendees: Fernando Portal<br>
Date: May 2, 2010</p>

<p>Arturo Torres, Nicolas Valenzuela, and Fernando Portal started Co-Op while
they were architecture students. They sought to integrate ideas of art with
methods of science - looking for design necessities. RECONSTRUYE was formed
because the mayor of Talca wanted to form a group of different specialists who
could help with reconstruction. Fernando believes Ushahidi could be useful in a
post-emergency situation because it could be a tool for civil society. The
government's plan for the earthquake is for 13 private companies to make
donations and decide how reconstruction should be done. This is not a problem
per say, but it is controversial and civil society hasn't been given much
information on reconstruction. RECONSTRUYE and Sur Maule (an NGO in Talca) hope
to give people more of a voice in the process. The companies are to submit
their reconstruction plans in three months, but the architects believe a plan
for Talca alone should take a year.</p>

<p>Fernando said it would be helpful to see how other organizations have
deployed Ushahidi and agreed to have us meet Nicolas and Arturo to travel to
Talca the next day. Fernando, Arturo and Nicolas are now administrators on the
Ushahidi-Chile platform.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #2</b><br>
Organization: Chile Ayuda<br>
Attendees: Caroline, Anahi, Pedro Fuentes Schuster Christian Van der Henst<br>
 Date: May 2, 2010</p>

<p>The purpose of the meeting was to understand Chile Ayuda's future
involvement with Ushahidi. Pedro Fuentes confirmed:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Chile Ayuda can be first technical referral for organizations in Chile
    using Ushahidi. Oscar and Patrick can be second referral if Chile Ayuda
    aren't able to do it. Chile Ayuda will not deploy new Ushahidi
  projects.</li>
  <li>Francisca Varela and Christian Van der Henst will work with SMS.</li>
  <li>Ushahidi-Chile will put Chile Ayuda's logo on the web page along with a
    paragraph about them; we need to e-mail Pedro again to remind him for
    this.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pedro will meet Patrick with the rest of the team in New York. Christian may
also be able to meet Ushahidi people in San Francisco.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #3</b><br>
Organization: Sur Maule (Talca)<br>
Attendees: Caroline, Anahi, Oriana Arellano, Caty Olivares<br>
Date: May 3, 2010</p>

<p>Sur Maule is an NGO that has worked in Talca district for 5 years on civil
society projects - adult education, trainings, etc. They also have a project
with RECONSTRUYE. There are around 250,000 people in Talca district and the
earthquake affected an estimated 8,000 families. Concepcion got more press
attention after the earthquake, but Talca could likely suffer more in the long
term. It is a town of family-run businesses-people literally lost their
businesses to the earthquake and now don't have jobs. The main risk of the
private sector taking charge of reconstruction: people are not given an option
of what the city will look like. Sur Maule is most concerned that the business
responsible (grupo Hurtado Vicuña) won't allow a public forum on
reconstruction so the public won't have a say.</p>

<p>Immediately after the earthquake, the local radio station in Talca took
calls so people could share information on where the damage was. Oriana noted
that Ushahidi also does this, but it has the advantage of archiving the
information. Sur Maule is interested in using Ushahidi as a record of Talcas
destruction, for long-term monitoring of reconstruction and also for soliciting
input from the public on how reconstruction is going and could be improved.
While they only work in Talca, they are also interested in meeting other
organizations or universities working with the platform to learn what they are
doing in other regions.</p>

<p>Carmen, a former journalist is working on their Web site and with social
media so she could conceivably be in charge of administering the page.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #4</b><br>
Organization: University of San Sebastian, Concepci&oacute;n<br>
Attendees: Caroline, Anahi, Miguel Hernandez, Pablo Escobar<br>
Date: May 4, 2010</p>

<p>San Sebastian is a private university and Miguel and Pablo, both professors,
said the students are generally interested in volunteering and have already
been involved in earthquake relief projects. Caroline and Anahi traveled to
Tacahuano to see the damage caused by the tsunami - the port town is
completely destroyed. Both professors were really excited about the possibility
to have students involved in something like the Situation Rooms of SIPA and
Fletcher. They are admins on the Ushahidi-Chile page and we agreed to schedule
a training for the students via Skype from New York.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #5</b><br>
Organization: Global Voices Summit<br>
Attendees: Caroline, Anahi, Jaroslav Valuch (Ushahidi Haiti), Emily Jacobi
(Digital Democracy) Felipe Baytelman (Executive Director Chile Ayuda) Fabiola
Torres (Universidad de Chile student) and 200 more.<br>
Date: May 5 - 6, 2010</p>

<p>The two Ushahidi-Chile members met Jaro from Ushahidi-Haiti and Emily Jacobi
from Digital Democracy at the conference. Felipe from Chile Ayuda participated
in a session about Chilean media after the earthquake. Jaro, Anahi and Caroline
hosted a seminar about using Ushahidi for crisis mapping that was attended by
about 12 people. The focus on the meeting was to explain lessons learned and
future steps of the the two deployments. There was also a session on using
Ushahidi for election monitoring and Anahi spoke with a group from Brazil who
are interested in using the platform to monitor Brazil's upcoming elections.
Fabiola Torres is a journalism student at the University of Chile who learned
about Ushahidi through Twitter two days after the earthquake. She believes
students at her university would be interested in learning to use the platform
and Caroline will schedule a training session with her.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #6</b><br>
Organization: Universidad de la Frontera<br>
Attendees: Patricia Pena, Sandra Soto<br>
Date: May 5, 2010</p>

<p>The two persons met work with a consortium of NGOs called <a href="http://www.accionchile.cl/">Acci&oacute;n</a> which Sur Maule is also part of. Universidad de la
Frontera would like to share the Ushahidi page with the entire consortium -
this makes sense because a lot of the NGOs are regionally based but are
interested in knowing how reconstruction is going in other regions.</p>

<p>As far as for Sandra Soto, her M-Health Project would need to work from a
different platform than the existing Ushahidi-Chile page and Ushahidi-Chile
suggested her that RapidSMS would be better for her project. Anahi put her in
touch with people who may be able to assister her with RapidSMS. Sandra gave us
a contact with the Red Cross in Concepcion who is interested in geo-referencing
information from the affected areas.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #7</b><br>
Organization: CIPER<br>
Attendees: Caroline, Francisca Skoknic, Pedro Ramirez<br>
Date: May 5, 2010</p>

<p>Caroline met with two journalists from <a
href="http://ciperchile.cl/">CIPER</a>, a nonprofit investigative journalism
project. Francisca is an acquaintance of Fernando from RECONSTRUYE. CIPER had
tried to make their own Google map based on information that was e-mailed to
them from the public in order to track structural damage right after the
earthquake, but found a lot of the information people were e-mailing wasn't
correct. They know RECONSTRUYE and are interesting in watching how the platform
develops as a large part of their work in the coming months will be monitoring
reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #8</b><br>
Organization: Accion<br>
Attendees: Anahi, Patricia Pena, Alicia Sanchez from Accion<br>
Date: May 6, 2010</p>

<p>Patricia and Alicia wanted to understand how they can use the platform.
Anahi showed them the admin page, how to customize the platform and they talked
about the best way to organize the flow of information if the 40 organization
that are part of Accion are going to use the Ushahidi page. They asked if the
SIPA team could go to Temuco and train the organizations on the use of the
platform. Anahi showed them also how the organization working in the field
could take advantage of the platform, the alert system, and the SMS system.
They were very enthusiastic about it. They are thinking about using it for
accountability purposes, and want to go back to Temuco to speak with the rest
of the organization about it. Anahi added Alicia, Patricia and Eduardo as
Administrators of the platform so that they can look at it and start
experimenting its use. We agreed on following up after they talk with the
organizations that are part of Accion, probably next week. Ushihidi-Chile
offered to do a Skype training or more than one if they need it.</p>

<p><b>Meeting #9</b><br>
Organization: Chile Moz<br>
Attendees: Caroline, Anahi, Jaroslav Valuch, Eduardo Escarez<br>
Date: May 7, 2010</p>

<p>Eduardo is not a programmer, but part of his job is to work with students at
local tech universities. He is going to try to assemble a team of PHP
programmers who could work on fixing bugs in the Ushahidi-Chile platform and be
the technical team supporting the organizations taking the platform in
Chile.</p>
