  <h3 class="c-grants-side-reference-title">Help us build a better Web</h3>

  <p>We're a non-profit organization working to build a Web that is open, accessible, safe and — most of all — a force for good.</p>
  <p>Mozilla builds communities and gives people tools to control their online experience. We are about enriching people's lives instead of  benefiting shareholders. We believe a better Web means a happier future for all of us — and we depend on your collaboration and financial support to build it.</p>
  <p>So please consider making a donation today: <a href="{{ donate_url('grants') }}">Join us here</a>.</p>
