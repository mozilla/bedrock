            <h3>Help us build a better Web</h3>

            <p>We're a non-profit organization working to build a Web that is open, accessible, safe and — most of all — a force for good.</p>
            <p>Mozilla builds communities and gives people tools to control their online experience. We are about enriching people's lives instead of  benefiting shareholders. We believe a better Web means a happier future for all of us — and we depend on your collaboration and financial support to build it.</p>
            <p>So please consider making a donation today: <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/page/contribute/join-mozilla">Join us here</a>.</p>
