{% extends 'base-resp.html' %}
{#
 Base template for pages used to signup for one particular newsletter.

 Inheriting templates should put their body content in the newsletter_content block.

 They must also set the newsletter_title and newsletter_id variables.

 Finally, they can fill in the blocks 'success_en' and 'success_non_en' with
 the page body to display to English and to non-English users after they
 subscribe.  The default text here can be used as an example, but is probably
 not exactly right for newsletters other than the Mozilla & You newsletter.
