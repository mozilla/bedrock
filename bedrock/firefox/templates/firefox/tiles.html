<h3>{{ _('What are Tiles?') }}</h3>

{% if LANG in ['en-US'] %}
When you open a new tab in Firefox, you see several rectangles that link to different websites.
Others call them squares, windows or bookmarks; we call them Tiles.

<h3>{{ _('What are Enhanced Tiles?') }}</h3>

<p>
{% if LANG in ['en-US'] %}
Enhanced Tiles customize a Firefox user’s new tab page, making it unique to that user.
Firefox will display Tiles based on a user’s browsing history, and the experience is easy to customize and organize with a simple, drag-and-drop interface.
Enhanced Tiles replace the default screenshot with a better image — they are only displayed for participating sites that the user has visited in the past.
{% else %}
{{ _('Existing Firefox users will be offered a set of Enhanced Tiles based on their browsing history.') }}
{{ _('The Enhanced versions replace the default screenshot with a better image and are displayed only for sites that the user has visited.') }}

{% endif %}

<h3>{{ _('What are Directory Tiles?') }}</h3>

<p>
{% if LANG in ['en-US'] %}
For new users, the new tab page in Firefox provides recommendations on interesting and important content through Directory Tiles.
This includes both referrals to sponsored partner sites (clearly marked as “sponsored”) and content we considers important to our mission of advancing the public benefit of the Internet.
{% else %}
{{ _('New Firefox users are initially given a set of Directory Tiles as suggestions for sites that may be of interest to them.') }}
{{ _('Instead of displaying a blank set of Tiles, Firefox shows content from Mozilla and some Mozilla partners.') }}
{{ _('All partner content is marked as “sponsored” and users have complete control to edit or remove any Tile.') }}
{% endif %}
</p>

{% if LANG in ['en-US'] %}

<h3>Greater personalization of your Firefox experience</h3>

<p>
Part of choosing independent means you get to control what you see — and to remove what you don’t want to see.
Your new tab page will reflect as much or as little of your browsing behavior as you choose.
It can be unique to you, or it can be completely blank.
It is easy to rearrange Tiles in your new tab page, and to keep or remove any individual Tile.
</p>

<h3>A voice for Mozilla</h3>

<p>
Some Tiles contain sponsored content, while others relate to the <a href="{{ url('mozorg.contribute') }}">Mozilla project</a>, our community and associated causes.
We believe that these are beneficial for every Web user to know about to help advance our mission to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web.
</p>

<h3>Easy to control</h3>

<p>
Tiles are easily pinned, moved around or removed using simple drag-and-drop and close interfaces.
If you do not want to see any Tiles, you can deactivate them completely in two clicks through the new tab gear control.
</p>

{% endif %}

<h3>{{ _('Respects your privacy') }}</h3>

<p>
{% if LANG in ['en-US'] %}
