    <h1 class="mzp-c-article-title">Why Firefox?</h1>
    <p>
        Firefox is independent and a part of the not-for-profit Mozilla, which fights for your online rights, keeps corporate powers in check and makes the internet accessible to everyone, everywhere. We believe the internet is for people, not profit. Unlike other companies, we don’t sell access to your data. You’re in control over who sees your search and browsing history. All that and exceptional performance too.

      Most major browsers update automatically, which means that when a new version is available, your system will download and install it for you. So that’s one less thing you have to worry about keeping on top of. First find out <a href="{{ version }}">which version of your browser you’re on</a>. Then, if auto update is switched off, here’s how to manually update <a href="{{ firefox }}">Firefox</a>, <a href="{{ edge }}">Edge</a>, <a href="{{ chrome }}">Chrome</a>, <a href="{{ opera }}">Opera</a> or <a href="{{ safari }}">Safari</a>.
