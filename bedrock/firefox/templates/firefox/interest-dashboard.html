    <p>
      {% trans %}
        The Interest Dashboard uses both a site-matched and keywords text analysis to categorize interest. The former is based on the categorization of certain URLs we have a high confidence of belonging to a particular interest (i.e. ESPN being Sports). The latter uses statistical analysis of keywords that appear within the title of a webpage mapped to keywords that appear on Wikipedia pages. Those pages are then summarized to IAB’s (Internet Advertising Bureau) content categories.

        Yes. If you have set up a Sync account and enabled add-on and history sync, your Interest Dashboard data will sync across different devices and browsers. You may disable add-on and history sync by unchecking the “add-on” and “history” checkbox under My Sync. For more detailed explanation on uninstalling add-ons, go here:
