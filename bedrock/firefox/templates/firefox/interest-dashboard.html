    <p>
      {% trans %}
        The Interest Dashboard uses both a site-matched and keywords text analysis to categorize interest. The former is based on the categorization of certain URLs we have a high confidence of belonging to a particular interest (i.e. ESPN being Sports). The latter uses statistical analysis of keywords that appear within the title of a webpage mapped to keywords that appear on Wikipedia pages. Those pages are then summarized to IAB’s (Internet Advertising Bureau) content categories.
