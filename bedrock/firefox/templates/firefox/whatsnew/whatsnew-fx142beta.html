      <p>Firefox is introducing Semantic History Search, a new feature that makes
        it easier to search your Firefox history by understanding the meaning and
        context, instead of relying solely on keywords. Built on a vector-based
        model, it offers a more intuitive browsing experience while keeping your
        data private by processing everything locally on your device.</p>

      <p>With the release of Firefox Beta 142, Mozilla’s community will be among
        the first to experience this new feature and provide feedback directly to
        the team behind it. Your input will help shape the feature while it’s
        still in development.</p>
