  <li>Add <a href="{{ url('firefox.facebookcontainer.index') }}">Facebook Container</a> to prevent Facebook from seeing the websites you visit</li>
  <li>Sign up for <a href="https://monitor.firefox.com">Firefox Monitor</a> to receive alerts you if your personal info is involved in a data breach</li>
  <li>Set <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtEMYSJyd-c">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> to “Strict” to block ad trackers</li>
</ul>
