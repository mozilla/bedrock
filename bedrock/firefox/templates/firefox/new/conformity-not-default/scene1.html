  <h2>
    You do you.
  </h2>

  <p>
    We get what it’s like to be different. We’re the only non-corporate, non-conformist browser. We celebrate everybody’s right to break the mold, buck the trends, and demand better than the default.

  <h3>Tune it up</h3>

  <p>
    Ad blockers, video downloaders, ghosters, grease monkeys, rocket launchers...Firefox has literally thousands of tools to dial in your web game just the way you like it.

{% block content_2 %}
  <h3>Lock it up</h3>

  <p>
    Because we’re backed by a non-profit, we make your privacy the default. When you browse on Firefox, what you browse is your business.

  <h3>Put a leopard on it</h3>

  <p>
    You may not believe this, but your browsing bar could have a leopard on it. Right now. Or Snoopy. Or Adriana Lima. Or it could just be aggressively purple. There’s a theme out there that’s so you.
  </p>

  Be different. Try Firefox today.
