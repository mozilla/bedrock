  <p>To make your computer more secure, we recommend upgrading your operating system to a newer version as soon as possible (plus, you’ll be able to use Firefox!). But, if you can’t do so, here are some alternate browsers that should be compatible with your current system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> for Windows 95 and above and Mac OS 10.3 and above</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.icab.de/">iCab</a> for Mac OS 10.3 and above</li>
  </ul>
