            Mozilla Firefox ESR is meant for organizations that manage their client desktops, including schools,
            businesses and other institutions that want to offer Firefox. Users who want to get the latest features,
            performance enhancements and technologies in their browsing experience should download Firefox for
            <a href="{{ firefox }}">personal use</a>, as these improvements will only be available to ESR users several

            Yes, an ESR will be automatically upgraded to the subsequent ESR. System administrators can disable
            automatic updates by managing ESR through their deployment system. From a major version to the other
            (example: the 52 to 60 migration), the updates will be proposed only after the X.2.0 version is released.
            For example, users of 52 have been updated only when 60.2.0 has been published.
