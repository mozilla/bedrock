Just watch out for in-game purchases and monitor the online chat, where kids could be paired with random teammates in public matches.</p>
        <p>Kids love Fortnite for lots of reasons. Younger gamers are drawn to it because it has a more cartoonish look than other, more gory video games. Older kids like that it’s a way of interacting with peers and socializing with friends — as well as complete strangers — so it could require parental moderation.</p>

      <div class="c-faq-answer">
        <p>Kids are spending more time with digital devices — and at younger ages — than ever before. <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Where-We-Stand-TV-Viewing-Time.aspx" rel="external" data-cta-type="link" data-cta-position="firefox-for-families-faq" data-cta-text="The American Academy of Pediatrics">The American Academy of Pediatrics</a> has helpful guidelines for limiting screen time for young kids. They recommend preschoolers age 2-5 have no more than 1 hour of high-quality screen time each day. That's because little kids learn best from interacting with the physical world and with caring grown-ups.</p>
        <p>The reality is, there's no magic number that's perfect for every kid. What's important is the quality and age-appropriateness of your kids' content, and how your kids engage with it, and balancing their time with and without screens in a way that's healthy and supports their development. With any entertainment you choose for your kids — movies, games, TV shows, apps — you want to look for how it engages your child. For example, if it makes them happy and gets them learning new skills and life lessons — great. But if it's stressing them out and teaching them negative behaviors — it's time to pull back from that media.</p>

    <!-- CYBERBULLYING -->
    <details>
      <summary>
          <h5>Some kid made a TikTok about my kid, but didn't mention her by name. Is this cyberbullying, or am I overthinking it?</h5>
      </summary>
      <div class="c-faq-answer">
        <p>It depends.</p>
        <p>Cyberbullying is repeated and unwanted hurtful words or behavior that occurs online. It includes sharing negative or harmful content about someone on purpose. Examples of cyberbullying include:</p>
        <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
          <li>Sending hurtful texts or messages</li>
          <li>Posting inappropriate photos or videos on social media</li>
          <li>Hacking accounts</li>
          <li>Spreading mean rumors online</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you think your child is being bullied online, help them take a break. Then, think about whether they're being hurt on purpose or repeatedly. If the answer is no, talk with them about <a rel="external" data-cta-type="link" data-cta-position="firefox-for-families-faq" data-cta-text="dealing with hurtful online behavior" href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-teach-my-child-about-safe-online-behavior{{ csm_utm_params }}">dealing with hurtful online behavior</a>.

      <div class="c-faq-answer">
        <p>It's not about whether they collect it — it's a matter of what they do with it.</p>
        <p>Young people are the most surveilled and tracked generation ever. Their personal information, activities, hobbies and networks are exposed — and often for sale — from birth.  With this information, companies form detailed files that can determine children’s futures.</p>
        <p>Kids’ online activity is largely on mobile devices, meaning their location, activities and conversations are tracked. And with an increase in community cameras, Bluetooth trackers and other sensors, kids are watched wherever they go.
