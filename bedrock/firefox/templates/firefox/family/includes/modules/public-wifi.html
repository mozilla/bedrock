        <p>Lots of schools offer free wifi to students, but they also offer sloppy
          joes in the cafeteria. Both can be pretty sketchy.</p>

          <h4 class="c-title-uppercase">Why should u care?</h4>
          <p>You don’t have to be a genius-level hacker to snag private information
            from people connecting to open networks. The technology is cheap and
            readily available.</p>

          <h4 class="c-title-uppercase">What to do:</h4>
          <p>With all the unlimited data plans out there, it’s best to just use your
            provider’s cellular data rather than public wifi. But if there’s no
            reception or data is an issue, <a href="{{ url('products.vpn.landing') }}">get a trustworthy VPN</a>
            and activate it before you connect to the network.</p>
