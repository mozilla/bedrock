              Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences
              in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate
              location from the Firefox program files.

              Previously, all Firefox installations shared a single profile by default.
              On January 28, Firefox will begin creating dedicated profiles for each
              installation, starting with Firefox 67. On that date, Firefox will begin
              using a dedicated profile for Firefox Nightly, and this Nightly installation
              will no longer share a profile with other Firefox installations on your
              computer. Other versions of Firefox (Beta, ESR and Firefox) will have a
              dedicated profile once they reach release 67.

              This will make Firefox more stable when switching between installations on
              the same computer and will also allow you to run different installations of
              Firefox at the same time.

            {% trans %}
              Users who have already manually created separate profiles for different
              installations will not notice the change (this has been the advised
              procedure on Nightly for a while).

              If you do nothing and are currently running different installations of Firefox
              that share the same profile, your Nightly installation will start running a
              dedicated profile on January 28th. If Nightly is the first installation of
              Firefox you open on or after January 28, it will use your existing profile.
              If Nightly is not the first installation you open, Nightly will get a new
              profile. Your existing profile will remain associated with the first
              installation you open on or after January 28.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
              If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations
              of Firefox, you can use a Firefox Account to keep them in sync.

            {% trans fxa=url('firefox.accounts') %}
              A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all
              of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs
              and secure password storage. <a href="{{ fxa }}">Get started with a Firefox Account.</a>
