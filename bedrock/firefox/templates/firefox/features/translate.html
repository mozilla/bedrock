<p>The internet is filled with amazing stuff, but a lot of it is not written in
  English — making billions of people around the globe need a translator just to
  use the internet. You can <a href="{{ url('firefox.all') }}">download Firefox in over 100 languages</a>,
  so your browser menus, notifications and messages are in your preferred language,
  but that doesn’t solve the problem of all that amazing content you use your browser
  to find.</p>

<h2>Firefox Translations</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/?utm_source=www.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=firefox-features" rel="external noopener">Firefox Translations extension</a>
  can automatically translate content from the web pages you visit. Unlike some
  cloud-based alternatives, this extension translates text locally in Firefox,
  so the content you’re translating doesn’t leave your machine.</p>
<p><a class="mzp-c-button mzp-t-product mzp-t-secondary" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/?utm_source=www.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=firefox-features" rel="external noopener">Get Firefox Translations</a></p>

<h2>To Google Translate</h2>
<p>Google Translate, with over 100 languages* at the ready, is used by millions
  of people around the world. But moving back and forth between translate.google.com
  and the page you’re trying to read isn’t an ideal experience. The
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/to-google-translate/?utm_source=www.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=firefox-features" rel="external noopener">To Google Translate</a> extension makes translating the page you’re
  on easier than ever.</p>
<p><a class="mzp-c-button mzp-t-product mzp-t-secondary" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/to-google-translate/?utm_source=www.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=firefox-features" rel="external noopener">Get To Google Translate</a></p>
<p>Once installed, simply highlight the text you want to translate and right-click to pull up a menu with two options: 1) Takes to you translate.google.com with your selected text automatically entered into the translation field; or 2) Listen to audio pronunciation of the phrase (powered by Google Text-to-Speech), which is helpful if you’re trying to learn a new language.</p>

<h2>Switch Languages in Firefox</h2>
<p>If you are already using Firefox, you can change your browser’s language or add
  languages to the Firefox interface.
