          Every computer program you run takes up some memory. When too much is used,
          your system can slooooowww down. Firefox aims for a balance — using enough
          memory to let you browse smoothly and leaving plenty of memory to keep your
          computer responsive.

          If your computer is already low on memory, this can cause a significant slowdown.
          Using Firefox’s latest version with multi-process can result in more available
          memory to run your favorite programs.

          faster.
