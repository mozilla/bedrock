          Sharing is caring, but that should be your call. Firefox Private Browsing
          automatically erases your online info like passwords, cookies and history
          from your computer. So that when you close out, you leave no trace.

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          Some websites and ads attach hidden trackers that collect your browsing info
          long after you’ve left. Only Firefox Private Browsing has tracking protection
          to block them automatically.

        {% trans %}
          Not only do trackers collect info, they can weigh down your browsing speeds.
          Only Firefox Private Browsing blocks ads with hidden trackers, so you can drop
          the baggage and browse freely.
