    No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice)
    browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep
    running at top speed.

    <p>
    Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process
    browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload.
    With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.

    We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now Firefox is
    bringing better performance to online gaming. Our powerful browser reduces
    lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster,
    leaner browsing.
