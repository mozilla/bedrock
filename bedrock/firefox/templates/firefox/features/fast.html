          No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice)
          browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep
          running at top speed.

        <p>
        {% trans %}
          Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process
          browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload.
          With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.

          We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now Firefox is
          bringing better performance to online gaming. Our powerful browser reduces
          lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster,
          leaner browsing.
