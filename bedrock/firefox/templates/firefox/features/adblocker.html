    Finally, ad companies can track your movements online. It’s called "re-targeting" and it works like this: You visit a site and click on a product. That site puts a small piece of code in your browser called a cookie. When you surf the web, sites will know you clicked on that product and they’ll display ads for it.

      Many media and news organizations make most of their money from advertising. If you block ads on their sites, they won’t get paid. If enough people block ads, business could suffer, and so will the quality of reporting and writing. Luckily, most ad blockers let you make exceptions for your favorite sites.
