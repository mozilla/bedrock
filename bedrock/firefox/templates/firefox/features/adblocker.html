            An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page. Another way ad blockers work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.

            These ads might be loud video ads, ads that follow you around the web, trackers, third-party cookies, and more. To use an ad blocker, you can search for ad blocker add-ons that are available in your browser. <a href="{{ firefox }}">Firefox</a>, for example, has <a href="{{ addons }}">this list of approved ad blocker add-ons</a>. Click on this list (or ad blockers that are approved for your browser) and see which fits your needs.
