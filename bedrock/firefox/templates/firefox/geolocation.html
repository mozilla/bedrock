    <p>
    {% trans %}
      Websites that use location-aware browsing will ask where you are in
      order to bring you more relevant information, or to save you time while
      searching. Let’s say you’re looking for a pizza restaurant in your area.
      A website will be able to ask you to share your location so that simply
      searching for “pizza” will bring you the answers you need... no further
      information or extra typing required.

    {% trans %}
      This service is totally optional &ndash; Firefox doesn’t share your
      location without your permission &ndash; and is done with the utmost
      respect for your privacy. And, like all elements of Firefox, it’s being
      created using open standards to ease adoption by Web developers.

      If you consent, Firefox gathers information about nearby wireless access
      points and your computer’s IP address. Then Firefox sends this
      information to the default geolocation service provider, Google Location
      Services, to get an estimate of your location. That location estimate is
      then shared with the requesting website.

      Accuracy varies greatly from location to location.  In some places, our
      service providers may be able to provide a location to within a few
      meters. However, in other areas it might be much more than that.  All
      locations returned by our service providers are estimates only and we do
      not guarantee the accuracy of the locations provided.  Please do not use
      this information for emergencies. Always use common sense.
