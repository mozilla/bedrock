      <p>The Mozilla Support platform (a.k.a. SUMO) receives over 20 million visits each month. Itâ€™s the go-to place for Firefox users to find troubleshooting tips, get help, and discover useful resources in multiple languages.</p>

      <p>But itâ€™s more than just a help siteâ€”itâ€™s also a community. Here, you can connect with fellow Firefox fans from around the world. You might even come across contributors like <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/sumo/2024/07/29/contributor-spotlight-jefferson-scher/{{ params }}">Jefferson</a> or <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/sumo/2024/09/26/contributor-spotlight-noah-y/{{ params }}">Noah</a>, who have been sharing their expertise for more than a decade and have an incredible depth of knowledge about your favorite browser.</p>

      <p>Next week, weâ€™re hosting an <strong>Ask a Fox</strong> event! ðŸŽ‰ And weâ€™re inviting not only our long time community members, but newcomers and also Mozilla staff to jump in and help Firefox users in the Community Forums. The event will run for an entire week and feature lots of activities, including special calls with teams like WebCompat, Web Performance, and Thunderbird. And of course, there will be swag giveaways and many more perks too!</p>
