                Our flagship product, the Firefox Web browser, is and will continue
                to be a fundamental lever in driving the Web forward and advancing
                the Mozilla mission. Firefox for Android is our popular mobile
                browser which currently enjoys a 4.5-star average rating in Google
                Play.

                Firefox OS is the first truly open operating system for mobile
                devices, delivering the same security, privacy, customization and
                user control that people have come to expect from the Firefox
                browser. Mozilla has built the technologies and APIs to make the Web
                a rich and viable platform for the mobile industry. With the support
                of valued partners from across the mobile ecosystem, Firefox OS
                phones are now on sale in 10 markets globally (as of mid-November
                2013), and Mozilla will continue to advance its development and
                adoption.

                At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we improve the overall
                health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers.
                We succeed when we build products that people love, and when other
                organizations adopt the traits and features we care about into
                competing products.

                Unlike our major competitors, Mozilla achieves success by helping
                more people make choices about what software they want to use, what
                level of participation they would like to have online, and how to
                take part in building a better Internet. When we see growth in
                community contributors, software localizations, and a competitive
                browser market, for example, we know we are moving toward our goals.
