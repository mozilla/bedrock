            Mozilla continues to believe that the internet can and should be a positive force for individuals and for
            societies. However, there are deep problems to be solved to make this true in an enduring way for the
            future. An obvious first step is to help people understand and protect ourselves from current online harms.
            This gives us better knowledge to address the problems at a deeper level — to create new and better
            experiences where respect and security for the individual are built into the core product.

            Much of the optimism and openness that characterized the internet’s development has given way to growing
            skepticism and fear from consumers. As a result, recent years have witnessed a reckoning for the tech
            industry. People have started coming to grips with the unchecked growth of data-driven online services.
            They’ve begun to question the ease with which information core to their very identities can be captured,
            monetized and used against them. This has been compounded in the last two years by a rash of high-profile
            data breaches and other incidents that have laid bare how individuals’ data are being bought, sold and
            manipulated to influence everything from their buying habits to election results.

          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            A central challenge is the implicit exchange of data for services that is the business model of so many
            online services. This dynamic presents a growing threat to people’s privacy and ability to control their
            identities online. The problem has become even more acute with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence
            (AI) technology that can “learn” more about us than ever before and use this information to shape our
            digital experience, depriving us of the freedom that has historically defined how we use the internet.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            But people have begun to resist the tradeoff of their data for convenient access to valuable and
            increasingly necessary online products and services. In response, companies have tried to reclaim users’
            loyalty by appearing to champion the cause of privacy. At Mozilla, we do more than just talk about privacy.
            From our founding, we have been motivated by a clear commitment to put people’s privacy and security at the
            core of everything we build and everything we do.

            As an innovator with decades of experience in privacy and data security, we at Mozilla have important
            insight to share, and we have a responsibility to do so. In 2018, we captured opportunities to address the
            challenges this moment presents and continued building on these efforts in 2019. This reports speaks to our
            efforts over the past two years.

            Our multi-pronged approach included consumer product and technology development that give end users and
            developers the tools they need to navigate today’s increasingly complex digital landscape. We also drive a
            user-first agenda on the public policy and advocacy fronts, pushing for greater transparency, corporate
            accountability and technology standards that put people back at the center of online life.

            To this end we brought a key privacy feature to our flagship Firefox browser—enabling tracking protection by
            default, because we believe that the price of embracing a digital lifestyle shouldn’t be giving up one’s
            identity. Our promise is to help make clear that privacy is non-negotiable, and we delivered on this promise
            in 2018 and 2019 by providing consumers with a range of tools beyond the browser that are built from the
            ground up to provide security and preserve privacy.

          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            In addition to tackling privacy and security at the product level, we have pushed for changes at the
            ecosystem level over the past two years. Leveraging our significant experience and unique standing at the
            crossroads of tech, policy and advocacy to stand up for users by pressing for strong privacy and security
            standards and corporate accountability both within the industry and in public policy.

            We publicly called on tech giants Facebook and YouTube to do better by their users and the web by bringing
            greater transparency to consumers and reevaluating the manner in which the content they recommend is served
            up. We also led the fight for Net Neutrality as the named plaintiff in the case against the FCC.

            Mozilla is unique. Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla currently consists of two
            organizations: the 501(c)3 Mozilla Foundation, which backs emerging leaders and mobilizes citizens to create
            a global movement for the health of the internet; and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation,
            which creates products, advances public policy and explores new technologies that give people more control
            over their lives online, and shapes the future of the internet platform for the public good. Each is
            governed by a separate board of directors. The two organizations work in concert with each other and a
            global community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner: Mozilla.

            In response to increasing public concern about data privacy and how people’s personal information is being
            used, many technology companies have answered by putting the onus to protect their privacy on users. In some
            cases that has meant users being forced to change settings, pore over inaccessible terms of service, or take
            control of complicated product features. In other instances, companies have resorted to promising easy
            access to online safety and privacy only to those who stay within the confines of their closed operating and
            device ecosystems.
            {% endtrans %}

            While we’re pleased to see privacy and online security, two issues <a href="{{ privacy }}">we’ve long
              championed and backed up</a> with product features, business practices and industry pressure, these other
            companies’ approaches have had a deleterious effect—boxing in and overburdening users, limiting the web’s
            interoperability and making the internet less trustworthy.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Still we welcome this attention to a critical issue because we understand that our mission—the success of
            the internet as a global public resource—depends on users trusting that their safety will be protected.
            While some of our competitors may be new to the notion of privacy, it has always been at the core of
            everything we do. Mozilla is secure by default; it always has been, and it always will be.

            The pervasive and hidden nature of third-party, cross-site tracking has allowed companies virtually
            unfettered access to the data generated by people’s online activities. This has enabled micro-targeting and
            predictive profiles to be built by companies which influence the types of ads, services and information
            people are presented online. Without the ability to curb this type of data collection, people’s control over
            their online experiences is severely limited.

            %}
            We backed up our commitment to making sure Firefox users are afforded privacy and control online by adding
            <a href="{{ etp }}">Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) to the browser on desktop and Android as a default
              feature in 2019.</a>
            We made this move after first rolling ETP out as a browser setting users could enable in August 2018.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            But we started on this journey of figuring out a way to safely block third-party, cross-site tracking
            without disrupting the core internet browsing experience nearly a decade earlier with an effort that was
            then called Do Not Track.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Taking the lessons from this prior exploration, when we began developing ETP in 2018, we first engaged
            publishers and other content creators to fully understand the impact that turning ETP on by default would
            have on the user experience and the ability of web site owners to reach their desired audiences. After
            months of experimentation and user and developer testing and feedback, we successfully moved ETP to a
            default feature in the Firefox browser.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Since July 2019, the Firefox browser with ETP on by default has blocked more than 10 billion trackers—that’s
            roughly 125 trackers per day, per Firefox user. But we didn’t want users to just take our word for it; in
            2019, we also added a Protections Report, which enables Firefox desktop browser users to see the types and
            volume of trackers (including cryptomining and fingerprinting) that have been blocked based on the personal
            browsing history stored on their devices.

            {% trans mr="https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/firefox-reality/" %}
            We’re bringing the ETP functionality to the development of future products and new technologies as well. In
            2019, we began testing ETP in Firefox Preview, the beta version of our soon-to-be released Android browser,
            which is powered by the Mozilla-built GeckoView engine. Our AR/VR and mixed reality browser, <a href="{{ mr

            It’s our belief that the power to decide when and what people share about themselves online should be an
            explicit choice extended to people regardless of who makes the products and services they are using. It is
            with this in mind that Mozilla Foundation first launched the *Privacy Not Included Buyer’s Guide a few years

            safe, secure, and private. The 2018 *Privacy Not Included Buyer’s Guide product list grew to 76 connected
            products across six categories and included a “Creep-o-meter” to measure feedback about which products

            In the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections next year Mozilla has taken a number of steps, led by

            and if it can’t, stop its practice of running political ads altogether. Citing the ways in which

            The work we’ve done in 2019 builds upon efforts that began in 2018 with the U.S. midterm elections. We gave
            users easy access to Firefox extensions designed to help spot propaganda bot patterns; the ability to

            In the early days of Mozilla, a web browser was the primary, and in many cases the only, way to access the

            piece of the puzzle, so in 2018 and 2019, we expanded our product and service offerings to keep users secure

            In 2019 Mozilla continued its fight for Net Neutrality in the U.S. as the named plaintiff in the federal
            case <a href="{{ fcc }}">Mozilla v. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a>. After years of battling
            over this issue, the
            opinion that came down in October 2019 opened a path for states to put net neutrality protections in place,
            even as the fight over FCC federal regulation is set to continue. Though disappointed that the court’s
            decision failed to restore net neutrality protections at the federal level, Mozilla will remain a key player
            in the fight for these essential consumer rights as they continue to play out in the <a

            2019 brought to a close another legal battle in which Mozilla played a key role: the fight for copyright
            reform in the EU. After almost three years of debate and activism, in 2019 EU lawmakers approved the EU
            Copyright directive. We had hoped that the new rules would provide an opportunity to bring European
            copyright law in line with the realities of the 21st century.

            Sadly, that did not turn out to be the case, and we expect copyright to return to the political agenda in
            the years to come, as the real underlying issues facing European creators and press publishers persist.
            Mozilla’s focus remains on minimizing the negative impact of this law on Europeans’ internet experience and
            the ability of European companies to compete in the digital marketplace.

            Another arena in which Mozilla took an active stand for consumers in 2019 was on the issue of encrypted DNS
            traffic. Currently, the internet relies on outdated architecture that allows almost all of the most basic
            online traffic—the addresses you pull up when you visit a website—to flow unencrypted, making this
            information to attack and leaving user data open to access by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who are
            largely responsible for directing this traffic today. Since 2017, Mozilla has been pushing to change this
            internet protocol with the adoption of a new standard DNS over HTTPS (DoH) which would encrypt this traffic.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            In 2019, Mozilla released a set of clear guidelines for a Trusted Resolver Program that spells out publicly
            the terms for handling this data securely. We began testing in the protocol with Firefox users in the U.S.
            only. The effort has been met with pushback from the large ISPs, whose ability to monetize and control this
            data would be severely limited if DoH were to become the new standard. The discussions about DoHs
            advancement continue with lawmakers, ISPs and other companies who are exploring joining Mozilla’s trusted
            resolver program as we expand testing of the protocol.

          <p>
            {% trans %}
            In addition to pushing for change at the system level, Mozilla also works primarily through the efforts of
            its separate policy and Foundation teams to drive lawmakers and other companies to adopt practices that
            improve consumers’ online safety and the overall health of the web.

            With over 1,000 full-time employees worldwide, Mozilla Corporation employee compensation is benchmarked to
            market by role and level balancing total compensation between individual and company performance with a
            <a href="{{ pay }}">pay-for-performance</a> compensation model.

            For non-executive roles, we employ a market framework of 20 top public and private tech companies that we
            compete with for talent.

            For VPs and above, we benchmark compensation against a blended peer group comprised of 70% similarly-sized
            public and private tech companies and 30% non-profit organizations. This approach serves to reinforce our
            mission-first orientation. Consistent with market best practice, at least 70% of compensation for senior
            leadership is “at risk” and tied to individual and company performance.

            Mozilla Foundation non-profit programs are carried out by 80 employees and thousands of volunteers around
            the world. For the Mozilla Foundation, the core goal of the compensation philosophy is to attract, motivate
            and retain top talent while ensuring total pay is competitive and reasonable in relation to our nonprofit
            status. We benchmark against a peer group that reflects the unique nature of our organization and aim to
            provide an appealing, flexible and market-appropriate total compensation package.

            In CY 2018, Mozilla Corporation generated $435.702 million from royalties, subscriptions and advertising
            revenue compared to $542 million in CY 2017. 2017 was an outlier, due in part to changes in the search
            revenue deal that was negotiated that year. Despite the year-over-year change, Mozilla remains in a strong
            financial position with cash reserves to support continued innovation, partnerships and diversification of
            the Firefox product lines to fuel its organizational mission.
