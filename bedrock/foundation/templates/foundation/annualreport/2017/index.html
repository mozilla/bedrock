              2017 and 2018 have been years of the “techlash” — a growing chorus of sentiment along
              the lines of, “The Internet is broken! What can we do?” For half of humanity, digital
              life is online life. We are experiencing the glories of online life, where knowledge
              and opportunity abound in ways unimaginable a decade ago. We also see all the flaws of
              humanity on display, from violence to lies to exploitation to the control and seeming
              lack of accountability of a small handful of companies.

              For a generation we have looked to the big tech companies as the voice of what digital
              life could be. Today trust in the big tech platforms and their effect on life has eroded.
              The focus is becoming how to limit the effects of the tech platforms. There is a growing
              hunger for experienced and credible voices who can describe and build a better Internet.

              Mozilla seeks to help fill this void. Not alone of course — many participants are needed
              to create meaningful improvement in digital life. Mozilla plays a particular role — to
              bring the voice of world-class technologists, advocates and activists who are intimately
              familiar with the internet architecture, products and experiences into the creation of a
              better internet.

              For twenty years Mozilla has been at the heart of the internet/web platform, building core
              capabilities and product features aimed at security, privacy and individual empowerment and
              control. We share this capability with today’s giant tech “platforms” but we are radically
              different in our structure and motivation. Mozilla works to ensure the internet is a global
              public resource, open and accessible to all. We build consumer products to help make this
              internet a reality, with Firefox as our flagship product. We seek to give consumers choices
              so that we can use the power of consumers and the market as levers to build a healthier
              internet. Increasingly we are also developing new ways to bring policy, technology and
              committed people to impact issues from misinformation to the surveillance economy and
              manipulation of people through use of our personal information and behavioral profiles.

              Mozilla works with many others to pursue this goal. When the United States Federal
              Communications Commission attacks net neutrality or the Indian government undermines
              privacy with Aadhaar, we see people around the world — including hundreds of thousands
              of members of the Mozilla community — stand up and say, “Things should not work this way.”
              Whether you call this work open source or digital rights or internet health, there is a
              growing movement around the world of people who are actively trying to make the
              internet/digital life better.

              Mozilla is unique. Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla
              currently consists of two organizations: the 501(c)3 Mozilla Foundation, which
              backs emerging leaders and mobilizes citizens to create a global movement for
              the health of the internet; and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla
              Corporation, which creates products, advances public policy and explores new
              technologies that give people more control over their lives online, and shapes
              the future of the internet platform for the public good. Each is governed by a
              separate board of directors. The two organizations work in concert with each
              other and a global community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the
              single banner: Mozilla.

              Mozilla was ready to respond to this breaking news because of our long-standing engineering and

              the Mozilla Foundation called for a full investigation of the Equifax breach, which exposed the
              personal financial data of nearly 150 million American consumers, and was preparing a campaign
              that called on retailers to stop selling the Cloudpets toy due to privacy and security concerns.
              Mozilla Corporation was able to draw from its notable roster of privacy-centric product solutions
              including <a href="{{ focus }}">Firefox Focus</a>, the <a href="{{ privacy }}">advanced privacy
              protections in Firefox</a>, and <a href="{{ containers }}">Multi-Account Containers</a>, which

              Mozilla believes that attracting diverse talent that is motivated, creative and passionate

              the nature of work and the talent required.

              approach serves to reinforce our mission-first orientation. Consistent with market best
