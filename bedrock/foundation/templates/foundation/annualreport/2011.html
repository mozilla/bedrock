      <p>
        Mozilla‘s vision of the Internet is a place where anyone can
        access information, a place where everyone can hack and tinker;
        one that has openness, freedom and transparency; where users have
        control over their personal data and where all minds have the
        freedom to create and to consume without walls or tight restrictions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In less than 20 years the Internet has changed our lives. It
        is a powerful platform with unprecedented opportunity and connectedness.
        But even with great growth and innovation there are significant
        challenges to this vision of a healthy Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mozilla is mobilized to ensure the protection of the Web and to
        empower tomorrow’s webmakers and Web users. Today, Mozilla is growing
        — with more employees, contributors, products and locations — to
        ensure that the Web remains an open, vibrant ecosystem. Because, the
        Web is the platform for building the world we want.
      </p>

        and focus areas that enable us to ensure the healthy growth of this
        large and precious global resource.

              Mozilla is mobilizing millions of people to build the world
              they want. Mobilizing to set the mobile Web free from proprietary
              platforms and gatekeepers. Mobilizing to empower the world's next
              two billion Web users. And mobilizing to build a new generation

            </p>

            <p>
              Moving forward we will continue to focus on building products,
              technology solutions and educational offerings that incorporate
              Mozilla values into the Web. Today, Mozilla’s mission remains as
              important as ever. From Firefox through Firefox OS to our new
              Mozilla Webmaker educational offering, the goal is empowerment.
              It’s about unlocking the full creative power of mobile; standing
              up for user sovereignty, privacy and freedom; and helping millions
              of people move from using the Web to actively building its future.

              Firefox OS is the first truly open mobile platform. Developers
              are already embracing HTML5, but so far HTML5 applications on
              mobile have been held back because they can’t access the device’s
              underlying capabilities the way that native apps can. Firefox OS
              overcomes these limitations and provides the necessary
              <abbr title="Application Program Interfaces">APIs</abbr> to
              show how it is possible to run an entire device using open
              standards.

              establishing HTML5 as a viable platform for the mobile industry.
              The Web as the platform will free developers to create groundbreaking
              new apps that work seamlessly across all devices, spurring a new
              era of innovation and creativity for the ubiquitous Web.

              In June 2012 we released an update to <a href="{{ mobile_url }}" rel="external">Firefox for Android</a>
              that we believe is the best browser for Android available. We completely
              rebuilt and redesigned the product in native UI, resulting in a
              snappy and dynamic upgrade to mobile browsing that is significantly
              faster than the Android stock browser. This made Firefox significantly
              faster on Android and delivered a much better browsing experience to
              users than the one offered by the device’s stock browser. We also
              added Do Not Track to Firefox for Android to let users express their
              intent for privacy, even on mobile and are the first mobile browser
              to offer Do Not Track. Firefox for Android is a critical part of
              supporting the open Web. This is a great start, but it is only a start.
              We want these opportunities to exist at all layers of our Web experience.

              we have seen with the desktop version of Firefox over the past year.
              Several performance and security improvements, memory enhancements make
              this the best Firefox yet. We're proud of the work that we're doing to
              make developing on Firefox easier by adding exciting tools for developers,
              like <a href="{{ cmdline_url }}" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">Developer Command Line</a>,

              Recently, we have been experimenting with ways to integrate social
              functionality into Firefox. Firefox will support a new Social API that
              lets developers integrate social services directly into the browser.
              The Social API will support multiple providers and has endless potential
              for integrating social networks, e-mail, finance, news and other
              applications into your Firefox experience. Our first experimental
              provider is Facebook.

              in opposition to the SOPA/PIPA bills in congress. For the first time,
              the Web community of more than 15 million people came together to
              speak against a policy that affected the Web as a whole. This historic
              protest represented a significant turning point for the Web as a way
              to engage the electorate and mobilize citizens for change.

            <h4>ACTA</h4>

              Early in 2012, Mozilla warned against the ratification of the
              Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (<abbr>ACTA</abbr>) by the
              European Parliament. <a href="{{ acta_url }}" rel="external" hreflang="en-US">In a blog post</a>,
              Mitchell Baker urged the policymakers that opaque processes were a
              “bad way to develop Internet policy” — in particular, that the global
              trade agreement was negotiated in private without open involvement
              of all the stakeholders. After massive street protests of Net-savvy
              citizens across Europe, the European Parliament rejected ACTA on
              July 4th in an unequivocal vote.

              — a video challenge for aspiring filmmakers, animators and creatives
              from around the world to produce and submit short films. These films
              made by Firefox fans, promoted and educated users about the issues
              that affect their online lives such as privacy and security. Most
              importantly, these filmmakers shared what makes Firefox different
              using their own voices. Celebrities and film-industry experts helped
              select the regional winners from more than 400 submissions from
              thousands of filmmakers worldwide.

          Mozilla is an organization that is fundamentally about people and
          making the Web better for everyone. The Mozilla community is essential
          to the success of the project. We can’t fight for an open, hackable and
          transparent Web without people who believe in and support that cause.
          We have Mozilla communities spanning the world and these remarkable
          people are responsible for coding, testing, localizing, hosting
          hackfests and summer code parties, teaching Webmakers, marketing,
          evangelizing Mozilla products and much more.

              designed to empower volunteers to become official representatives of
              Mozilla in their region, has grown to more than 350 people in more
              than 70 countries in a little more than a year. The program plays a
              critical role in helping Mozilla execute against its organizational
              goals around the promotion and development of Firefox OS, Firefox
              for Windows, Mac and Linux and Firefox for Android. Reps have
              organized more than 700 events around the world and have successfully
              recruited and trained hundreds of new contributors across dozens of
              functional areas.

              MozCamps are regional events that bring together core paid and
              volunteer Mozilla staff members from all areas of the project for
              two full days of presentations, discussions, brainstorms, work
              sprints, hackathons and, of course, a little bit of fun.

              While the main focus is on community leaders and core contributors,
              MozCamps also aim to train up future leaders — those Mozilla contributors
              who have been particularly active in the past six months and
              represent the next generation of Mozilla leadership in the
              community.

            <p>
              This year‘s MozCamps were held in Buenos Aires, Warsaw and
              Singapore, bringing together more than 300 employees and 600
              volunteers.

                    Passionate about reviving Songay, a dialect in his native Mali,
                    Mohomodou has led localization efforts to get Firefox translated
                    into Songay.

      <p>
        Along with this annual report, we released our audited financial
        statements for 2011. Mozilla remains well positioned, both financially
        and organizationally, to advance our mission of building openness,
        freedom and participation into the Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mozilla remains financially healthy; we continue to hire more
        people globally, we’ve opened new Mozilla Spaces around the world,
        have launched significant new initiatives such as Firefox OS and
        are able to support those with viable resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        The majority of our revenue comes from the search functionality
        in the Firefox browser. Google is the largest source of revenue and
        in December 2011, we announced that we negotiated a significant and
        mutually beneficial revenue agreement with Google. This new agreement
        extends our long term search relationship with Google for at least
        three additional years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mozilla has a number of other relationships in the Web community,
        as well as new relationships with mobile operators, device manufacturers,
        third-party content partners and other players in the mobile ecosystem.
