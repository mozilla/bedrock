  <p>{% trans %}The Internet is in a period of dramatic change. We've built the traits we
    care about -- innovation, opportunity, interoperability, individual control
    -- into one layer of Internet life through the browser. We also need to
    build these traits into the new ways people use the browser and the
    Internet. Three of our largest areas of focus are mobile, "Open Web Apps"
    and the social and data sharing aspects of the Web. We're also increasing
    participation and collaboration with the Mozilla Drumbeat project.{% endtrans %}</p>

          Mobile is a critical and growing piece of Internet life. It's important
          to provide people with products that embody Mozilla values of openness,
          flexibility, and the freedom to innovate, just as we do for the desktop
          Web. One important step is making Firefox available for mobile devices.
          We released <a href="{{ maemo }}" target="_blank">Firefox on the Maemo (now known as Meego)
          platform</a> in Jan. of 2010.
          <a href="{{ android }}" target="_blank">Firefox for the Android operating system</a>
          is in beta now and will be available in a few months.{% endtrans %}</p>

      <p>{% trans %}Firefox 4 for mobile phones is a compelling product for both users and
        developers. For users, it includes what they love about Firefox: the
        Awesome Bar, support for browser Add-ons, integrated sharing, and
        seamless synchronization of bookmarks, history and passwords with
        desktop Firefox. And because Firefox 4 for mobile is built upon the same
        browser engine as desktop Firefox, it provides developers with the same
        rich support for HTML5 and related technologies.{% endtrans %}</p>

          %}
          We also created "Firefox Home" -- an app for the iphone that brings a
          range of useful Firefox information and features to iphone users.
          <a href="{{ home }}" target="_blank">Firefox Home was released in July of 2010</a>
          and was recently selected as a top 10 must-have iphone app by
          <a href="{{ nytimes }}" target="_blank">the New York Times</a>.
          (Note that Firefox Home is <strong>not</strong> a full browser for
          the iphone; Apple forbids
          development of such a product in the terms of its software developer
          kit.)

      <p>{% trans %}We know that the "app" and "app store" model has a set of
        characteristics that people like. These include such things as
        discoverability, ratings, easy installation, easy payment for paid apps,
        and quick access from the device. However, the current app model also
        has traits that threaten some of the characteristics that have made the
        Web so vibrant a platform, particularly in the mobile space. Apps are
        often device specific and platform specific. Information we create in an
        application is stuck in that application and / or that platform. One
        doesn't join a unified whole as one can with the Web. App-related
        information isn't generally linkable or findable. In addition,
        developers often need to get permission from one or more gatekeepers to
        reach people -- from a network operator, a device manufacturer, a
        "store" operator. Similarly, consumers must go through these filters to
        access new functionality.{% endtrans %}</p>

        People are generating immense amounts of digital information about
        themselves. Right now there's no good way for an individual to control
        or manage the information we generate other than to rely on the
        application (such as the photo, recommendation, commerce or social
        networking website) where we posted it. It's also hard for a person to
        share information in the ways we want, so that we feel comfortable and
        safe with how the information we've created gets shared. We need to
        evolve the Web so that it is easier for people to share information when
        they want to, and to restrict access when they want to. We've started a
        set of experiments to figure out how to implement this idea, with
        experiments focused on sharing, identity, social contacts, and encrypted
        syncing of data among various machines. For example,
        <a href="{{ f1 }}" target="_blank">F-1 is a browser extension</a>
        that allows you to share links from any webpage
        in a fast and fun way.

          Mozilla's work to build openness and empowerment into the Internet has historically
          been almost completely focused on building key technical infrastructure
          – the browser and mail clients, and increasingly related services. This
          year we launched Mozilla Drumbeat to expand our scope. Mozilla Drumbeat
          projects use open technologies to bring participation, collaboration and
          empowerment to other aspects of online life. In 2010 we've focused on
          education, and making more audio, visual and international content
          possible.
          <a href="{{ webcraft }}" target="_blank">Peer-to-Peer University School of Webcraft</a>
          and our <a href="{{ festival }}" target="_blank">Drumbeat Festival</a>
          explore a variety of ways that educational possibilities
          can be broadened through collaborative online learning. The
          <a href="{{ movies }}" target="_blank">Web-Made-Movies project</a>
          demonstrates how the open technologies of the Web can
          enhance video content. The
          <a href="{{ subtitles }}" target="_blank">Universal Subtitles project</a>
          provides an open, collaborative way for people
          to add subtitles in multiple languages to any content. We've also set up
          a <a href="{{ fund }}" target="_blank">Drumbeat Open Web Fund</a>
          which gives people a
          chance to donate and show their support for Mozilla's efforts to expand
          into these new areas.
