      We've made <a href="{{ speed }}" target="_blank">dramatic speed and performance
      advancements</a> across the
      board in Firefox 4. Everything from startup time to page load speed to
      graphics and JavaScript performance are screaming fast in Firefox 4 due to
      major improvements to our JavaScript engine, including the addition of the
      new J&auml;gerMonkey JIT compiler and support for hardware accelerated
      graphics. The Firefox 4 performance numbers speak for themselves, both in
      comparison to previous versions of Firefox and in comparison to other
      modern
      Web browsers.

  <p>{% trans %}Firefox 4 has a fresh and streamlined look to make it easy for
    people to
    engage with the Web the way they want. Today, many of us use the Web in
    complex and idiosyncratic ways. We "live" in a few website applications, we
    visit many other websites briefly or repeatedly, we interweave work and
    personal tasks, we share, we complete many quick tasks in the midst of
    ongoing interaction with other websites.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans beta=php_url('/firefox/beta/') %}To make these
    experiences effortless and fun, we've developed features to
    reduce the complexity of navigating today's web. These include enabling "app
    tabs" that are always instantly available, placing tabs on top of the URL
    bar, and Panorama, a highly visual approach to grouping related websites.
    Firefox 4 also integrates Firefox Sync to offer people an encrypted and
    seamless Web experience across desktop and mobile devices. Firefox Sync
    gives us access to our bookmarks, browser history, saved passwords and
    recently open browser tabs, no matter where we are. Early adopters can check
    out the <a href="{{ beta }}" target="_blank">most recent beta</a>; general
    consumers should wait until we get to a final release.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}In addition, Mozilla plays a key role in pushing the industry to
    adopt open
    Web standards like HTML5. Firefox 4 adds considerable new capabilities to
    the Web platform by pioneering support for Web technologies like the 
    &lt;video&gt; tag and the WebM codec which enable video without plugins, and 
    WebGL for great 3D graphics. It also improves existing tools like CSS, Canvas 
    and SVG to make exciting Web pages. Firefox 4 enables developers to create rich new
    experiences on the Web.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}We couldn't build such an amazing Firefox without our community
    of contributors and beta testers. They are exceptional, and a key part of the
    reason why the future of Firefox has so much promise.{% endtrans %}</p>

    {% trans feedback=php_url('/firefox/beta/'), awesome="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/army-of-awesome" %}
      Mozilla has tens of thousands of people contributing code and helping to
      localize and evangelize Firefox, and we've worked to expand/increase the
      ways that all Firefox users can participate in making Firefox better. With
      Firefox 4 Beta, we introduced a <a
        href="{{ feedback }}" target="_blank">Feedback Add-on</a> from Mozilla
      Labs Test Pilot, which
      lets people opt-in to take part in anonymous studies that help us make
      Firefox a better experience. This addition encourages feedback and gives
      our beta testers a voice. More than 1 million people have opted-in to
      participate in Test Pilot studies and have provided hundreds of thousands
      of pieces of feedback about Firefox 4 so far. Mozilla also recently launched
      a community care program called <a
        href="{{ awesome }}" target="_blank">"Army of Awesome"</a> to enable
      Firefox users to respond to each other and
      answer support questions on Twitter. In the first couple of weeks,
      hundreds of volunteers have already begun responding to thousands of user 
      requests on Twitter.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}The browser world is now intensely competitive and products are
    improving constantly. Firefox continues to be at the forefront of technology and user
    experience. Firefox brings a great product and Mozilla's vision of openness
    and empowerment directly to more than 400 million people in more than 80
    languages. We also spur these developments indirectly by serving as an
    "honest broker" showing what Internet life can be, and encouraging others to
    build products that incorporate openness and individual control. This is an
    immense success for Mozilla.{% endtrans %}</p>
