  <p>{% trans %}Mozilla remains well positioned, both financially and organizationally, to
    advance our mission of building openness and participation into the
    Internet. Our financial situation is very similar to last year and our
    revenues continue to grow steadily.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}For the calendar year 2009, Mozilla's consolidated reported revenues
    (Mozilla Foundation and all subsidiaries) were $104 million, up 34 percent
    from 2008 reported revenues of $78 million. Revenues include a 2009 reported
    loss of $104,000 in investments from the Foundation's long-term portfolio as
    a result of economic conditions and investment values at the end of 2009.
    This compares to our 2008 loss from investments of $7.8 million. Excluding
    investment gains and losses, revenues from operational activity were $104
    million compared to $86 million in 2008, an annual increase of 22 percent.
    The majority of Mozilla revenue continues to be generated from the search
    functionality included in Mozilla's Firefox product from organizations such
    as Google, Yahoo, Yandex, Amazon, eBay and a handful of others.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}Mozilla consolidated expenses for 2009 were $61 million, up approximately
    26 percent from 2008 expenses of $49 million. Mozilla operating expenses in
    2009 continued to remain highly focused on people and infrastructure. At the
    end of 2009, Mozilla was funding approximately 250 people working around the
    world. Total nonprofit grants, community donations and contributions in 2009
    remained at approximately $1 million as in previous years. Mozilla supported
    projects in 2009 included contributions to accessibility, community support,
    and education including such organizations as Mozdev, Software Freedom
    Conservancy, Seneca College, University of Toronto, UC Irvine, NorthEastern
    University, Creative Commons, Paciello Group, StopBadWare, the W3C, and
    accessibility support such as Orca screen reader, jQuery library and HTML 5
    video. In late 2009, the Mozilla Foundation began refocusing its public
    support programs toward Mozilla Drumbeat, which was launched in early
    2010.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}Total assets as of December 31, 2009 were $143 million compared with $116
    million at the end of 2008, an increase of 23 percent. Unrestricted net
    assets at the end of 2009 were $120 million compared with $94 million in
    2008, a 28 percent increase. The restricted assets remain the same as last
    year: a "tax reserve fund" established in 2005 for a portion of the revenue
    the Mozilla Foundation received that year from the search engine providers.
    As noted last year, the IRS has opened an audit of the Mozilla Foundation.
    We do not yet have a good feel for how long this process will take or the
    overall scope of what will be involved.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}We believe Mozilla's financial resources will continue with relative
    stability and we continue to use our assets to execute on our mission.{% endtrans %}</p>
