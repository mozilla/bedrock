  <h3 class="timestamp">November 18, 2010</h3>

    <p><span class="first-char">M</span>ozilla has filed its audited financial
      statements for 2009. This is the perfect time to look at the state of the
      Mozilla mission, our successes, our opportunities and our challenges.</p>

    <p>Mozilla exists to build individual empowerment, control and opportunity
      into the fabric of the Internet. We build great products as a public
      asset. Great products based on open source software, plus much, much more:
        </p>
    <ul>
      <li>nonprofit, public benefit;</li>
      <li>individual empowerment, community-driven;</li>
      <li>financial sustainability as merely a tool to enable these goals.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>We succeed by being different -- by pushing the boundaries of what "open"
      and "participation" and individual empowerment mean. Our success to date
      can be seen in by the way "open" and "participation" have become
      integrated into modern Internet life.</p>

    <p>The Mozilla mission is as important today as it ever was. There are new
      challenges to the freedoms we've come to expect with the Web. To succeed
      with our new challenges we must once again push the boundaries of what is
      possible technically, and what empowerment and opportunity mean. We must
      remain innovative, responsive and unrelenting in pursuing technical
      excellence. We must be even more forceful advocates for openness,
      opportunity and the importance of the individual. We must continue to be
      Mozilla, only more so.</p>

    <p>Mozilla is the underdog in our efforts to build participation and
      empowerment into the Internet. It's a big challenge to build our values
      into layers of the Internet where the commercial giants of our age are
      battling it out. Mozilla has always faced this kind of challenge. We
      started in an era when everyone "knew" our goals were impossible because
      Microsoft was invincible. Today, Mozilla is stronger than ever. Our
      opportunity to bring openness and choice to new aspects of the online
      experience is unprecedented.</p>

    <p>As we reflect on the state of Mozilla, there are three key areas that we
      look at:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="{{ url('foundation.annualreport.2009.a-competitive-world') }}">A Competitive World</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{ url('foundation.annualreport.2009.broadening-our-scope') }}">Broadening Our Scope</a></li>
      <li><a href="{{ url('foundation.annualreport.2009.sustainability') }}">Sustainability</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>It's time to demonstrate once again what the Web can be! Creativity,
      community, commitment. Dedication, determination, fun.</p>

    <p>Join in and build something unexpected and beautiful.</p>
