  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}How does Mozilla measure success?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}We don't measure success with numbers such as dollar amounts or number of
    employees. We measure success by how much we are doing to improve the
    overall health of the open Web. Mozilla achieves success by helping more
    people make choices about what software they want to use, what level of
    participation they would like to have online, and how to take part in
    building a better Internet. When we see growth in community contributors,
    software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for example, we
    know we are moving toward our goals.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}How does being a mission-driven, nonprofit change
    the way you approach the market?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}Our status as a mission-driven, nonprofit organization fundamentally
    affects our approach. It liberates us and allows us to focus, and take a
    long-term view on building a better Internet and developing a vibrant,
    creative community, rather than on traditional market concerns such as stock
    value. Growth in revenue and market share are simply indicators of the great
    things built by the Mozilla project rather than being objectives in
    themselves.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}How is Mozilla Drumbeat attracting new people to
    participate in Mozilla's mission of preserving an Open Internet?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}Mozilla has always been an organization that encourages participation from
    the community. Before Drumbeat we didn't have a way to help people implement
    ideas that support the health of the open Web, but are not a direct part of
    our software development and marketing process. Drumbeat is changing that.
    We're excited to provide a platform for anyone with a great idea, allowing
    them to attract like-minded individuals with the energy, talent, and
    commitment to make a difference. Developing a thriving ecosystem of projects
    that encourage shared learning, open participation, and user choice online
    is at the heart of the Mozilla mission. Drumbeat will be how we achieve that
    ecosystem, beginning with our first gathering of participants at the
    Drumbeat Festival, held November 2-5, 2010 in Barcelona, Spain.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}How does Mozilla generate revenue?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}The majority of Mozilla's revenue is generated from search functionality
    included in our Firefox product through all major search partners including
    Google, Yahoo, Yandex, Amazon, Ebay and others. Mozilla's reported revenue
    also include very important individual and corporate donations and grants as
    well as other forms of income from our investable assets.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}What was Mozilla's total revenue for 2009?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}Mozilla's consolidated reported revenue (Mozilla Foundation and all
    subsidiaries) for 2009 was more than $104 million, up approximately 34
    percent from 2008 reported revenue.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}Does Mozilla's relationship with Google affect the
    organization's independence?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}Our employees and community members frequently collaborate on Web standards
    and other issues of shared importance to our organizations with others,
    including Google. Our mission and development process, however, are
    completely unrelated to the revenue we earn from Google's search activity .
    Our open development process is governed by Mozilla's mission and our
    commitment to improving the Web. We do not vet our initiatives with
    Google.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h5 class="section-title">{% trans %}What is the status of the organization's contract
    with Google?{% endtrans %}</h5>
  <p>{% trans %}We have had a productive relationship with Google since 2004 and that
    relationship remains healthy. To date, we have renewed our contract three
    times, in 2005, 2006 and 2008. The current version extends through 2011. We
    believe that search providers will remain a solid generator of revenue for
    Mozilla for the foreseeable future.{% endtrans %}</p>
