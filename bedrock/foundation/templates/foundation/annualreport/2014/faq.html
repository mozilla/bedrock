                Mozilla’s products and programs reached hundreds of millions of people across the globe in 2014, empowering individuals online and cementing the Web as a global public resource. Our key initiatives aim to spur innovation, openness, and optimism on the Web.

                We continued our investment in Firefox for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and Firefox for Android, which allows smartphone users to take the best features of Firefox — from privacy protection to add-ons — anywhere they go. Firefox for Android crossed 100 million downloads in 2015.

                We began working toward an ambitious goal for Firefox OS: providing a truly peerless user experience. To us, this means creating an operating system that values customization, rich features, clever design, security, and inclusive ecosystems.

                We launched Developer Edition, the first browser dedicated to developers, which has been very successful in 2015.

               The first commercial Web games were launched, leveraging Mozilla-developed technology. We celebrated the availability of Mozilla-pioneered WebGL on all browsers, meaning that billions of users have the ability to see rich 3D content on the Web. We built on this in 2015 by putting plugin-free Web deployment in the hands of game developers working with WebGL and HTML5.

                We began work on creating outstanding new products in 2014, that launched in 2015. Firefox for iOS gives smartphone users more choice in the mobile ecosystem. And Tracking Protection offers Firefox users a new layer of control in Private Browsing.

                Among our policy initiatives, we began work to persuade the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to vote for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules, which resulted in victory in 2015.

                Mozilla deepened its commitment to Web literacy in 2014. We continued to develop tools and programs to teach Web literacy, including Webmaker and Maker Party. There were almost 3,000 volunteer run Maker Party ‘teach ins’ during July and August 2014.

                We also grew our efforts to build a next generation of open Web leaders through programs like Hive Learning Networks, OpenNews, Mozilla Science Lab, and the Ford-Mozilla Open Web fellowship. The work of leadership development programs was showcased at Mozilla Festival in London in October 2014 and again in November 2015.

                In 2014, Mozilla’s volunteer communities around the globe continued their tireless commitment to the Web. Some 10,000-plus Mozillians taught critical 21st-century skills to individuals of all ages and backgrounds; they translated open source products into a range of new languages; they defended the free and open nature of the Web; and much more. Mozilla’s contributors are the organization’s backbone, a powerful force for good and a perennial inspiration.

                At Mozilla, we gauge success by how we improve the Web’s health and how we improve users’ experiences. When our products and programs lead to a Web that is more open, and when users are delighted by our products, we’re succeeding.

                We also measure success through community contributions. When more people are volunteering their time and talents, they are expressing a belief in and commitment to Mozilla — and shaping the Web in a positive, productive way.

                We are committed to investing in Firefox and enabling more people to take control of their online life in a personal and customized Web experience. We will build on the expectations that come with users’ high ratings for Firefox for Android, and are excited to create an unprecedented mobile experience with Firefox OS. We will develop the experience of Firefox on its newest platform, iOS. Our Content Services team will look for new ways to create value for users, while enhancing their control, and building a more sustainable Web. We will continue to drive the adoption of standards that advance performance and stability online. We will continue to take a firm stand when the wellbeing of the Web and its users are at stake, voicing our views, testifying before government bodies, and providing input to numerous agencies and NGOs on strengthening the Internet. And we will continue to create educational opportunities that promote access for all and inspire the next generation of Web developers and digital citizens.

                Innovation stems from different ways of solving problems. It is crucial to us to maintain a diverse workforce to fuel those different approaches. Mozilla has elected to voluntarily and transparently share the information in its filing of the Employer Information Report <a href="{{ url }}">(EEO-1)</a> to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. This information reflects our U.S. Corporation employees only. Sharing it is an important step we are taking to improve diversity and inclusion at Mozilla and in the technology industry.
