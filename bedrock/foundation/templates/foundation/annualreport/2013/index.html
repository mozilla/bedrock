            The Web is a distributed, global platform, which, in just two
            decades, has irrevocably altered nearly everything we do: how we
            perform our jobs; elect our governments; invest in our educations;
            pursue our passions, and engage with our friends and families.

            The Mozilla project works to bring independence and choice to the
            Web so that everyone who uses it recognizes they possess the agency
            to shape it. We build communities of citizens who are passionate
            about the opportunities of a free and open Web, and who have the
            skills and know how to take control of their online experiences. We
            build products that showcase the vast capabilities of the Web and
            enrich peopleâ€™s lives.  Our mission is to keep the Internet
            accessible, so people worldwide can go beyond being users of the Web
            to also become creators and citizens of the Web.

            In 2013, we advanced this mission through products including:
            Firefox for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android;  Firefox OS; Content
            Services, and Cloud Services. We also ran a number of education and
            research programs such as Webmaker, OpenNews, the Mozilla Science
            Lab and Open Badges, helping bring the values of the open Web into
            the fields of education, journalism and beyond. Communities like the
            Mozilla Developer Network and Hive Learning Networks provided the
            chance for anyone to participate in  and contribute to our goals.

            Mozillians are a community of technologists, thinkers, builders, and
            educators who believe in the potential of a free and open Web. We
            work together from every corner of the world -- coding,
            volunteering, building, teaching -- to empower Web users everywhere
            through products and education. As Mozillians, we embrace community-
            based processes that promote participation, accountability and
            trust. These values are both core to our non-profit mission and how
            we do our work everyday.

            This annual report includes the audited financial statements for
            2013. The majority of our revenue comes from the search
            functionality in the Firefox browser through a number of major
            partners, including Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Amazon and eBay.
            This 2013 financial statement includes revenue from a three-year
            partnership with Google, our largest search provider, that was
            signed in December 2011.

            A percentage of our revenue comes from the public in the form of
            grants and individual donations. 119,751 people supported our non-
            profit work in 2013. These donations are directly applied to
            programs in the fields of education, advocacy, science and
            journalism that protect the free and open Web and build the next
            generation of leaders.
