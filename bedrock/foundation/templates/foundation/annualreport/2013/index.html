            <p>
              The Web is a distributed, global platform, which, in just two
              decades, has irrevocably altered nearly everything we do: how we
              perform our jobs; elect our governments; invest in our educations;
              pursue our passions, and engage with our friends and families.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Mozilla project works to bring independence and choice to the
              Web so that everyone who uses it recognizes they possess the agency
              to shape it. We build communities of citizens who are passionate
              about the opportunities of a free and open Web, and who have the
              skills and know how to take control of their online experiences. We
              build products that showcase the vast capabilities of the Web and
              enrich peopleâ€™s lives.  Our mission is to keep the Internet
              accessible, so people worldwide can go beyond being users of the Web
              to also become creators and citizens of the Web.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2013, we advanced this mission through products including:
              Firefox for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android;  Firefox OS; Content
              Services, and Cloud Services. We also ran a number of education and
              research programs such as Webmaker, OpenNews, the Mozilla Science
              Lab and Open Badges, helping bring the values of the open Web into
              the fields of education, journalism and beyond. Communities like the
              Mozilla Developer Network and Hive Learning Networks provided the
              chance for anyone to participate in  and contribute to our goals.

              Mozillians are a community of technologists, thinkers, builders, and
              educators who believe in the potential of a free and open Web. We
              work together from every corner of the world -- coding,
              volunteering, building, teaching -- to empower Web users everywhere
              through products and education. As Mozillians, we embrace community-
              based processes that promote participation, accountability and
              trust. These values are both core to our non-profit mission and how
              we do our work everyday.

              This annual report includes the audited financial statements for
              2013. The majority of our revenue comes from the search
              functionality in the Firefox browser through a number of major
              partners, including Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Amazon and eBay.
              This 2013 financial statement includes revenue from a three-year
              partnership with Google, our largest search provider, that was
              signed in December 2011.

              A percentage of our revenue comes from the public in the form of
              grants and individual donations. 119,751 people supported our non-
              profit work in 2013. These donations are directly applied to
              programs in the fields of education, advocacy, science and
              journalism that protect the free and open Web and build the next
              generation of leaders.
