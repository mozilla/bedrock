                Firefox provides independence and opportunity to hundreds of
                millions of people around the world in more than 90 languages
                across desktop and mobile platforms. Our focus has been on
                building products that drive the competition, energy and
                innovation we all need to keep the Web open, everywhere and
                independent.

                The Firefox browser, our flagship product, is the central
                platform we use to advance our mission to build a free and open
                Web. Firefox for Android, the mobile version of our browser, has
                been downloaded more than 80 million times.

                Firefox OS - the first truly open operating system for mobile
                devices - addresses the needs of the millions of people coming
                online for the first time via mobile devices. With the support
                of valued partners from across the mobile ecosystem, Mozilla
                continues to advance the Firefox OS smartphone development and
                adoption.

                Mozilla’s Webmaker program supports a growing global community
                dedicated to teaching digital skills and Web literacy with free
                tools and learning programs that fuel creativity for people of
                all ages. We believe that people need more than the right tools
                to take control of their online lives -- they also need the
                right skills and know how. Understanding how the digital world
                works is quickly becoming as important as understanding reading
                writing and math.

                In 2013, Mozilla’s many volunteer communities grew in both scope
                and effectiveness. Volunteers help translate our products and
                initiatives, making them locally-relevant worldwide; teach
                critical Web literacy skills to people of all ages and
                backgrounds; contribute code to our products, and advocate for
                effective policies to protect the free and open Web. We
                continually explore ways to support those contributors and
                inspire new ones to join.

                At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we improve the
                overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and
                developers. We succeed when we build products that people love,
                and when other organizations incorporate the traits and features
                we care about into competing products.

                Unlike some, Mozilla achieves success by helping more people
                make choices about what software they want to use, what level of
                participation they would like to have online, and how to take
                part in building a better Internet. When we see growth in
                community contributors, new ways to engage in shaping the Web,
                software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for
                example, we know we are moving toward our goals.

                all major search partners including Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex,
                Amazon, eBay and others. Mozilla’s reported revenues also

                that this allows us to identify appropriate sources of revenue
                that serve both the mission and our users. In addition, during
                2013 and 2014, key Mozilla Foundation programs like the Hive,
                Open News and the Open Web Fellows Program have received

                Our operating investments in our product lines grew in 2013 by

                product launches and we will continue to negotiate revenue
                contracts to support our business needs. Over the last few
                years, Mozilla’s investment focus has been significant in new
                areas such as our mobile and cloud services products. In
                particular, the rapidly expanding launches of Firefox OS and
                significant upgrades to our Firefox for Android browser have
                advanced our goal of opening the mobile ecosystem for users and

                world and the creation of community-based research labs and
                fellowships focused on bringing Mozilla’s values and methods to
