                  Firefox provides independence and opportunity to hundreds of
                  millions of people around the world in more than 90 languages
                  across desktop and mobile platforms. Our focus has been on
                  building products that drive the competition, energy and
                  innovation we all need to keep the Web open, everywhere and
                  independent.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Firefox browser, our flagship product, is the central
                  platform we use to advance our mission to build a free and open
                  Web. Firefox for Android, the mobile version of our browser, has
                  been downloaded more than 80 million times.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Firefox OS - the first truly open operating system for mobile
                  devices - addresses the needs of the millions of people coming
                  online for the first time via mobile devices. With the support
                  of valued partners from across the mobile ecosystem, Mozilla
                  continues to advance the Firefox OS smartphone development and
                  adoption.

                  Mozilla’s Webmaker program supports a growing global community
                  dedicated to teaching digital skills and Web literacy with free
                  tools and learning programs that fuel creativity for people of
                  all ages. We believe that people need more than the right tools
                  to take control of their online lives -- they also need the
                  right skills and know how. Understanding how the digital world
                  works is quickly becoming as important as understanding reading
                  writing and math.
                </p>

                  Programs such as Knight-Mozilla OpenNews, Mozilla Science Lab,
                  the Hive Learning Networks and Mozilla Advocacy all work to
                  bring the strengths and values of the open Web to new fields,
                  while working to protect a free and open Internet for everyone.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We created a Content Services team to build user control, trust
                  and transparency into personalized content and advertising
                  services, Our Cloud Services team continues to build new
                  services by introducing Firefox Accounts and Firefox Hello, the
                  first global communications system built directly into a
                  browser.

                  In 2013, Mozilla’s many volunteer communities grew in both scope
                  and effectiveness. Volunteers help translate our products and
                  initiatives, making them locally-relevant worldwide; teach
                  critical Web literacy skills to people of all ages and
                  backgrounds; contribute code to our products, and advocate for
                  effective policies to protect the free and open Web. We
                  continually explore ways to support those contributors and
                  inspire new ones to join.

                How do you measure success?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we improve the
                  overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and
                  developers. We succeed when we build products that people love,
                  and when other organizations incorporate the traits and features
                  we care about into competing products.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike some, Mozilla achieves success by helping more people
                  make choices about what software they want to use, what level of
                  participation they would like to have online, and how to take
                  part in building a better Internet. When we see growth in
                  community contributors, new ways to engage in shaping the Web,
                  software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for
                  example, we know we are moving toward our goals.

                What was Mozilla’s total revenue for 2013?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  Mozilla’s consolidated reported revenue (Mozilla Foundation and
                  all subsidiaries) for 2013 was $314M (US), as compared to $311M
                  in 2012.

                How does Mozilla generate revenue?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  The majority of Mozilla’s revenue is generated from search and
                  commerce functionality included in our Firefox product through
                  all major search partners including Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex,
                  Amazon, eBay and others. Mozilla’s reported revenues also
                  include very important individual and corporate donations and
                  grants, as well as other forms of income from our investable
                  assets.

                Are you exploring partnership opportunities to diversify your
                revenue stream?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  We currently have several key business partnerships and are
                  actively exploring new ones, as well as other potential revenue
                  opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’ll continue to build great open source products that help
                  people enjoy the richness of the Internet, and we’re confident
                  that this allows us to identify appropriate sources of revenue
                  that serve both the mission and our users. In addition, during
                  2013 and 2014, key Mozilla Foundation programs like the Hive,
                  Open News and the Open Web Fellows Program have received
                  generous new grants from organizations such as the the MacArthur
                  Foundation, Knight Foundation and Ford Foundation.

                How does Mozilla spend its money?
              </dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
                  Mozilla invests in both products and programs that further our
                  mission to keep the Web open and to retain our impact on the
                  Internet landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our operating investments in our product lines grew in 2013 by
                  40% year over year. This leaves us well positioned for future
                  product launches and we will continue to negotiate revenue
                  contracts to support our business needs. Over the last few
                  years, Mozilla’s investment focus has been significant in new
                  areas such as our mobile and cloud services products. In
                  particular, the rapidly expanding launches of Firefox OS and
                  significant upgrades to our Firefox for Android browser have
                  advanced our goal of opening the mobile ecosystem for users and
                  developers worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our investment in education and community programs grew 44% year
                  over year. The largest areas of increased spending were the
                  development of a grassroots digital literacy programs around the
                  world and the creation of community-based research labs and
                  fellowships focused on bringing Mozilla’s values and methods to
                  education, journalism and science.

                What is the status of the organization’s search partnerships?

              <dd>
                <p>
                  We no longer believe one global default search partner is the
                  right choice for our users or the Web. Our new strategy gives us
                  more opportunities to build connections between the browser,
                  websites and services, and the treatment of data that advance
                  our mission and values. The specific terms of our new commercial
                  agreement are subject to traditional confidentiality
                  requirements, and we’re not at liberty to disclose them.
