Mozilla was born out of this type of environment, as a reaction to an online world that was full of promise and potential - but was then threatened by a few giant companies limiting consumer choice, interoperability and the overall health of the Web. We faced and won that challenge together then, and we need to face it again in this new era.') }}</p>

    <p>{{ _('The first is making Firefox better. In the past, it took Mozilla 18 months or so to deliver new features. This year we moved to a six-week release cycle to keep our product updated more effectively. We are now delivering innovative Web technologies, not every year, but every few weeks. We are shipping new technologies like CSS Animations, Web Sockets, tear-off animation, and WebGL to hundreds of millions of users and all in record time. There’s more work to be done to make sure the new schedule works for everyone, but we’ve overcome the great hurdle of changing a process that served us well during our first decade.') }}</p>

    <p>{% trans donottrack="https://blog.mozilla.org/privacy" %}As part of that ongoing effort to put people in control of their Web experiences, we developed the <a href="{{ donottrack }}">“Do Not Track”</a> feature in Firefox for both desktop and mobile. Industry support quickly followed. Apple and Microsoft implemented the same solution into their browsers. The United States Federal Trade Commission publicly supported Do Not Track, and the Vice President of the European Commission called for adoption of Do Not Track by 2012. We intend to build on our work in this area, and will continue to act as an advocate for the user, exploring new ways to bring transparency and user control to online user data collection methods.{% endtrans %}</p>
