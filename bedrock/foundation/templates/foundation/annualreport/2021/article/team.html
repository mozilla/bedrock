  <p>
    Much of the content of this report is focused on a singular idea – renewing our investment
    in Mozilla’s innovation engine. We need to do this because the single most effective way
    to shape a better internet is by leading through the example of our products and using
    that to accelerate our policy and advocacy efforts. We are uniquely equipped to meet this
    moment because of how we are structured — we are at once a global community and two
    organizations — a non-profit working to ensure the internet remains a public resource
    that is open and accessible to all and a mission-driven business that creates and supports
    consumer products in line with our mission.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can best push against the idea that a better way is “impossible” by building things that
    prove it is absolutely possible, but only if you put the users of the internet first. To
    build a team with the skills, experience, vision, and grit to do the “impossible” while
    going toe-to-toe with the biggest, most well-capitalized companies in the world requires
    that we attract and retain the best minds from many backgrounds: leading tech companies,
    activist organizations, and government. We need a global team made of engineers, policy
    experts, activists, data scientists, marketers, artists, and startup founders.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission-driven focus provides us a critical advantage in that competition, as we offer
    a natural haven for talent hungry for the opportunity to do their best work on behalf of
    the users of the internet, rather than for shareholders or other special interests. But
    that emotional satisfaction is only one half of the compensation equation, we often have to
    compete with the most well-capitalized companies in the world, who offer compensation both
    through high salaries and stock.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to compete for the talent necessary for us to achieve these ambitious goals, we
    have developed a compensation strategy that enables us to attract and retain passionate
    and driven individuals who can bring this vision to life. Both the non-profit Foundation
    and the for-profit Corporation use a blended data set of compensation from both types of
    companies in determining the benchmarks for executive compensation, and both organizations
    use third-party compensation survey data to inform these benchmarks.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the Foundation, for both executive and non-executive compensation, we benchmark primarily
    against the non-profit and philanthropic sector (70% weight) blended with data from similarly
    sized technology companies (30% weight). In Executive compensation at the Corporation we
    benchmark primarily against mid-sized, for-profit technology companies (70% weight) blended
    with data from the non-profit and philanthropic sector (30% weight). For non-executive
    compensation at the Corporation, we benchmark only against the mid-sized, for-profit technology
    companies, with no blending of non-profit compensation data. We target compensation at the
    75th percentile of the blended data for MoFo executives, and the 75th percentile of the blended
    data for MoCo executives. As a non-profit-owned company, Mozilla Corporation is limited to
    using cash for performance-based pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    We apply this same philosophy and benchmarking against the market when it comes to compensating
    the board members of each entity. Foundation Board members are paid $25k per year for their time,
    and a small additional amount if they serve on committees. While Corporation Board members are
    paid $200k per year.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are always assessing our compensation philosophy to ensure it aligns with our mission and the
    markets in which we operate – today we have talented folks advancing our mission across the
    Foundation and Corporation in 31 countries. We expect we will further refine our efforts as we
    look to expand our ability to better capture opportunities around the world, particularly in
    Europe and Africa in the coming years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mozilla has accomplished a lot of amazing things in the last 25 years, and during our time on the
    board, we have been able to witness many advancements working to make the internet a healthier
    and better place. But, we know there is a lot more work to do, and we feel confident this is the
    team ready to take on the next chapter — and the ones after that.
  </p>

  <p>
    We aren’t investing in the next quarter, we are investing in the next quarter century — and the
    next 25 years promise to continue to bring a lot to celebrate online, often thanks to Mozilla.
