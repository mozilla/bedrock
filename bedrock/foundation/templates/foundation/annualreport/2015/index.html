            The Mozilla Foundation was created in 2003 and our mission is to ensure the
            internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.
            <a href="{{ url }}">The first principle</a> in that mission is understanding
            that the internet is an integral part of modern life — a key component in
            education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society
            as a whole.

            The growth of the web makes the Mozilla mission more important today than
            ever before. We see an exploding world of connected devices where parts of
            the web are being monopolized and controlled by a few. There are billions of
            people online, but not enough transparency and control in the form of
            security and privacy protections for users from companies, app developers
            and governments.

            web browser that hundreds of millions of people around the world use today.

            The Mozilla Foundation was formed in 2003 to protect the open nature of the

            The Mozilla Foundation focuses on advancing the Mozilla mission through
            education, advocacy and movement building. The Mozilla Foundation’s programs
            are carried out by 65 employees and thousands of volunteers around the
            world. These activities are funded by public support from individual donors
            and foundations and from royalties earned that are paid by the Mozilla

            Inclusion and diversity are central to the Mozilla mission. We know
            innovation stems from a diverse workforce to fuel different approaches.
            It is crucial for us to create and maintain a diverse workforce because
            this diversity of perspective and problem-solving outperforms individual
            ability. Mozilla has elected to voluntarily and transparently share the
            information in our filing of the Employer Information Report
            (<a href="{{ eeo }}">EEO-1</a>) to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
            Commission, as part of our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity.
            This information reflects our U.S. Mozilla Corporation employees only.
            Sharing it publicly is an important step we are taking to improve diversity
            and inclusion at Mozilla and in the technology industry. We are committed to
            ongoing transparency in this regard. You can find out more about Mozilla’s

            We also believe that attracting talent that is motivated, creative and
            passionate is crucial to our success. We want to attract and retain that
            talent while ensuring total compensation is competitively reasonable and
            aligned with Mozilla’s culture and mission. While the compensation
            philosophy is similar between the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
            Corporation, the market frameworks used to benchmark total compensation are
            different given the nature of work and the talent required. Mozilla
            Foundation is benchmarked against similar-sized nonprofit organizations,
            while Mozilla Corporation is benchmarked against a composite of
            similar-sized non-profits and for-profit consumer internet software
            companies. Mozilla seeks to align total compensation for its employees
            between individual and company performance.
