                At Mozilla, we measure success not only by the adoption of our products,
                but also by our ability to advance our mission. We do this by improving
                the health of the internet, increasing the control people have in their
                online lives, impacting the web with open technologies, and influencing
                open standards.

                The majority of Mozilla revenue is from Firefox Web browser search
                partnerships around the world. Mozilla’s work is also supported through
                grants and individual donations. These contributions fund our nonprofit
                work in education, journalism, science, leadership development and other

                The Mozilla Corporation entered into a new search strategy at the end of
                2014. We decided that one global default search partner was no longer
                the right choice for our users or the web. Instead, we adopted a more
                local and flexible approach by country to control our own destiny and to
                diversify the user experience and competitive landscape of web search
                globally.

                around the world.  The new search strategy increased the number of

                Inclusion and diversity are central to the Mozilla mission. We know
                innovation stems from a diverse workforce to fuel different approaches.
                It is crucial for us to create and maintain a diverse workforce because
                this diversity of perspective and problem-solving outperforms individual
                ability. Mozilla has elected to voluntarily and transparently share the
                information in our filing of the Employer Information Report
                (<a href="{{ eeo }}">EEO-1</a>) to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
                Commission, as part of our ongoing commitment to inclusion and
                diversity. This information reflects our U.S. Corporation employees
                only. Sharing it publicly is an important step we are taking to improve
                diversity and inclusion at Mozilla and in the technology industry. We
                are committed to ongoing transparency in this regard. You can find out

                (Firefox for iOS, Firefox Focus private browser). We will test and
                launch new features through the Test Pilot program and we’ll build the

                that developing an understanding of browser activity at scale unlocks
                the next generation of web discovery on the internet. Mozilla will
                continue to promote open standards and contribute to new web
                technologies (like <a href="{{ servo }}">Servo</a> and
