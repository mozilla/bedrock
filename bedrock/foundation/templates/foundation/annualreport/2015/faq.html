                  At Mozilla, we measure success not only by the adoption of our products,
                  but also by our ability to advance our mission. We do this by improving
                  the health of the internet, increasing the control people have in their
                  online lives, impacting the web with open technologies, and influencing
                  open standards.

                What was Mozilla’s total revenue for 2015?

                <p>
                  Mozilla’s consolidated reported revenue (Mozilla Foundation and all
                  subsidiaries) for 2015 was $421.3M (US), as compared to $329.6M in 2014.

              <dd>
                <p>
                  The majority of Mozilla revenue is from Firefox Web browser search
                  partnerships around the world. Mozilla’s work is also supported through
                  grants and individual donations. These contributions fund our nonprofit
                  work in education, journalism, science, leadership development and other
                  fields. And, in turn, all of the work we do at Mozilla contributes to
                  the overall sustainability and health of the Internet.

              <dd>
                <p>
                  More than 75% of Mozilla spending is on people-related investments to
                  produce the products and programs that support our mission: keeping the
                  web open, free, and accessible.

                <p>
                  2015 Total Operating Expenses in our People, Products and Programs were
                  relatively flat as we realigned product investments. There was a 6% year
                  over year growth from 2014.

                  In 2015, Mozilla invested in education and advocacy initiatives, working
                  to reinforce the importance of an open web and teach web literacy around
                  the world. In 2015, Mozilla also continued its commitment to
                  building a vibrant, healthy Web ecosystem defined by user choice in our
                  product, policy, and advocacy work.

                  The Mozilla Corporation entered into a new search strategy at the end of
                  2014. We decided that one global default search partner was no longer
                  the right choice for our users or the web. Instead, we adopted a more
                  local and flexible approach by country to control our own destiny and to
                  diversify the user experience and competitive landscape of web search
                  globally.

                  around the world.  The new search strategy increased the number of
                  options available to Firefox users. We have new partnerships with
                  DuckDuckGo, Google, Yahoo and more. We also continue to have
                  relationships with Amazon, Bing, Twitter, Wikipedia, and regional search

                  Firefox users can easily choose to change their search provider from a
                  number of pre-installed alternatives, including Amazon, Bing, Google,
                  Twitter, Wikipedia and many regional search providers. This supports our
                  <a href="{{ search_strategy }}">global search strategy</a> and

                  In 2015 and 2016, Mozilla entered into additional search partnerships,
                  bringing our total to 12 partners and including all major internet
                  search providers. The new search strategy diversified revenue sources
                  for Mozilla. While some of this is evident in the 2015 financials, the
                  improvement will be more notable in 2016.

                  Inclusion and diversity are central to the Mozilla mission. We know
                  innovation stems from a diverse workforce to fuel different approaches.
                  It is crucial for us to create and maintain a diverse workforce because
                  this diversity of perspective and problem-solving outperforms individual
                  ability. Mozilla has elected to voluntarily and transparently share the
                  information in our filing of the Employer Information Report
                  (<a href="{{ eeo }}">EEO-1</a>) to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
                  Commission, as part of our ongoing commitment to inclusion and
                  diversity. This information reflects our U.S. Corporation employees
                  only. Sharing it publicly is an important step we are taking to improve
                  diversity and inclusion at Mozilla and in the technology industry. We
                  are committed to ongoing transparency in this regard. You can find out

                  In 2017, Mozilla will continue our investments in product development
                  with a focus on more mobile products including connected devices
                  experiments and Firefox mobile products like those recently launched
                  (Firefox for iOS, Firefox Focus private browser). We will test and
                  launch new features through the Test Pilot program and we’ll build the
                  Context Graph as the recommender system for the web because we believe
                  that developing an understanding of browser activity at scale unlocks
                  the next generation of web discovery on the internet. Mozilla will
                  continue to promote open standards and contribute to new web
                  technologies (like <a href="{{ servo }}">Servo</a> and
                  <a href="{{ rust }}">Rust</a> with Project Quantum) to meet the
                  increasing performance and security needs as the internet grows and

                  In 2017, Mozilla will expand our work in protecting the health of the
                  internet through policy, advocacy, education and products. We will launch
                  our first Internet Health Report, a thorough, compelling examination of
                  the state of the open internet. Through both data and narrative
                  features, our inaugural report will unpack internet health through the
                  lenses of privacy and security, web literacy, digital inclusion,
                  decentralization, and open innovation.

                  Mozilla will continue to fuel the larger open internet movement.
                  Wielding advocacy campaigns and educational tools and curriculum,
                  Mozilla will work alongside allies in the realms of technology, civil
                  society, and journalism to build a powerful and effective movement.
