            Mozilla continues to believe that the internet can and should be a positive force for individuals and for
            societies. However, there are deep problems to be solved to make this true in an enduring way for the
            future. An obvious first step is to help people understand and protect ourselves from current online harms.
            This gives us better knowledge to address the problems at a deeper level — to create new and better
            experiences where respect and security for the individual are built into the core product.
            {% endtrans %}

          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Much of the optimism and openness that characterized the internet’s development has given way to growing
            skepticism and fear from consumers. As a result, recent years have witnessed a reckoning for the tech
            industry. People have started coming to grips with the unchecked growth of data-driven online services.
            They’ve begun to question the ease with which information core to their very identities can be captured,
            monetized and used against them. This has been compounded in the last two years by a rash of high-profile
            data breaches and other incidents that have laid bare how individuals’ data are being bought, sold and
            manipulated to influence everything from their buying habits to election results.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            A central challenge is the implicit exchange of data for services that is the business model of so many
            online services. This dynamic presents a growing threat to people’s privacy and ability to control their
            identities online. The problem has become even more acute with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence
            (AI) technology that can “learn” more about us than ever before and use this information to shape our
            digital experience, depriving us of the freedom that has historically defined how we use the internet.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            But people have begun to resist the tradeoff of their data for convenient access to valuable and
            increasingly necessary online products and services. In response, companies have tried to reclaim users’
            loyalty by appearing to champion the cause of privacy. At Mozilla, we do more than just talk about privacy.
            From our founding, we have been motivated by a clear commitment to put people’s privacy and security at the
            core of everything we build and everything we do.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            As an innovator with decades of experience in privacy and data security, we at Mozilla have important
            insight to share, and we have a responsibility to do so. In 2019, we captured opportunities to address the
            challenges this moment presents and continued building on these efforts in 2019. This reports speaks to our
            efforts over the past two years.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Our multi-pronged approach included consumer product and technology development that give end users and
            developers the tools they need to navigate today’s increasingly complex digital landscape. We also drive a
            user-first agenda on the public policy and advocacy fronts, pushing for greater transparency, corporate
            accountability and technology standards that put people back at the center of online life.

          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            To this end we brought a key privacy feature to our flagship Firefox browser—enabling tracking protection by
            default, because we believe that the price of embracing a digital lifestyle shouldn’t be giving up one’s
            identity. Our promise is to help make clear that privacy is non-negotiable, and we delivered on this promise
            in 2019 and 2019 by providing consumers with a range of tools beyond the browser that are built from the
            ground up to provide security and preserve privacy.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            In addition to tackling privacy and security at the product level, we have pushed for changes at the
            ecosystem level over the past two years. Leveraging our significant experience and unique standing at the
            crossroads of tech, policy and advocacy to stand up for users by pressing for strong privacy and security
            standards and corporate accountability both within the industry and in public policy.

            We publicly called on tech giants Facebook and YouTube to do better by their users and the web by bringing
            greater transparency to consumers and reevaluating the manner in which the content they recommend is served
            up. We also led the fight for Net Neutrality as the named plaintiff in the case against the FCC.

            mission like never before. As our work continues to gain urgency, we look forward to building on the
            investments we made in the last two years to win in a new era and write the next chapter of the internet for
            the benefit of all its present and future users.

            Mozilla is unique. Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla currently consists of two
            organizations: the 501(c)3 Mozilla Foundation, which backs emerging leaders and mobilizes citizens to create
            a global movement for the health of the internet; and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation,
            which creates products, advances public policy and explores new technologies that give people more control
            over their lives online, and shapes the future of the internet platform for the public good. Each is
            governed by a separate board of directors. The two organizations work in concert with each other and a
            global community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner: Mozilla.

            In response to increasing public concern about data privacy and how people’s personal information is being
            used, many technology companies have answered by putting the onus to protect their privacy on users. In some
            cases that has meant users being forced to change settings, pore over inaccessible terms of service, or take
            control of complicated product features. In other instances, companies have resorted to promising easy
            access to online safety and privacy only to those who stay within the confines of their closed operating and
            device ecosystems.
            {% endtrans %}

            While we’re pleased to see privacy and online security, two issues <a href="{{ privacy }}">we’ve long
              championed and backed up</a> with product features, business practices and industry pressure, these other
            companies’ approaches have had a deleterious effect—boxing in and overburdening users, limiting the web’s
            interoperability and making the internet less trustworthy.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Still we welcome this attention to a critical issue because we understand that our mission—the success of
            the internet as a global public resource—depends on users trusting that their safety will be protected.
            While some of our competitors may be new to the notion of privacy, it has always been at the core of
            everything we do. Mozilla is secure by default; it always has been, and it always will be.

            The pervasive and hidden nature of third-party, cross-site tracking has allowed companies virtually
            unfettered access to the data generated by people’s online activities. This has enabled micro-targeting and
            predictive profiles to be built by companies which influence the types of ads, services and information
            people are presented online. Without the ability to curb this type of data collection, people’s control over
            their online experiences is severely limited.

            We backed up our commitment to making sure Firefox users are afforded privacy and control online by adding
            <a href="{{ etp }}">Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) to the browser on desktop and Android as a default
              feature in 2019.</a>
            We made this move after first rolling ETP out as a browser setting users could enable in August 2019.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            But we started on this journey of figuring out a way to safely block third-party, cross-site tracking
            without disrupting the core internet browsing experience nearly a decade earlier with an effort that was
            then called Do Not Track.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            Taking the lessons from this prior exploration, when we began developing ETP in 2019, we first engaged
            publishers and other content creators to fully understand the impact that turning ETP on by default would
            have on the user experience and the ability of web site owners to reach their desired audiences. After
            months of experimentation and user and developer testing and feedback, we successfully moved ETP to a
            default feature in the Firefox browser.

            Since July 2019, the Firefox browser with ETP on by default has blocked more than 10 billion trackers—that’s
            roughly 125 trackers per day, per Firefox user. But we didn’t want users to just take our word for it; in
            2019, we also added a Protections Report, which enables Firefox desktop browser users to see the types and
            volume of trackers (including cryptomining and fingerprinting) that have been blocked based on the personal
            browsing history stored on their devices.

            It’s our belief that the power to decide when and what people share about themselves online should be an
            explicit choice extended to people regardless of who makes the products and services they are using. It is
            with this in mind that Mozilla Foundation first launched the *Privacy Not Included Buyer’s Guide a few years

            safe, secure, and private. The 2019 *Privacy Not Included Buyer’s Guide product list grew to 76 connected
            products across six categories and included a “Creep-o-meter” to measure feedback about which products

            When experts identified The 2019 European Union Parliamentary Election as under threat from fake and

            And when it became clear that was unlikely to happen by the platforms themselves before voting day, our own

            political ads running on various platforms and provide a concise “behind the scenes” look at how these ads

            In the run-up to the U.S. presidential elections next year Mozilla has taken a number of steps, led by

            The work we’ve done in 2019 builds upon efforts that began in 2019 with the U.S. midterm elections. We gave

            traffic. Currently, the internet relies on outdated architecture that allows almost all of the most basic
            online traffic—the addresses you pull up when you visit a website—to flow unencrypted, making this
            information to attack and leaving user data open to access by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who are
            largely responsible for directing this traffic today. Since 2017, Mozilla has been pushing to change this
            internet protocol with the adoption of a new standard DNS over HTTPS (DoH) which would encrypt this traffic.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            In 2019, Mozilla released a set of clear guidelines for a Trusted Resolver Program that spells out publicly
            the terms for handling this data securely. We began testing in the protocol with Firefox users in the U.S.
            only. The effort has been met with pushback from the large ISPs, whose ability to monetize and control this
            data would be severely limited if DoH were to become the new standard. The discussions about DoHs
            advancement continue with lawmakers, ISPs and other companies who are exploring joining Mozilla’s trusted
            resolver program as we expand testing of the protocol.
            {% endtrans %}
          </p>
          <p>
            {% trans %}
            In addition to pushing for change at the system level, Mozilla also works primarily through the efforts of
            its separate policy and Foundation teams to drive lawmakers and other companies to adopt practices that
            improve consumers’ online safety and the overall health of the web.

            To that end, in 2019 Mozilla Foundation launched a petition <a href="{{ apple }}">urging Apple to
              automatically reset iPhone users’ unique Identifier for Advertisers (IDFAs) every month.</a> The IDFA is a
            random device identifier
            assigned by Apple to a user’s device. Advertisers use this to track data so they can deliver customized
            advertising. The IDFA is used for tracking and identifying a user (without revealing personal information),
            allowing advertisers to access aggregated data. While iPhone users can currently disable the IDFA manually,
            automatic resets would make it harder for companies to build profiles of users over time.

A decentralized approach leaves contact data on people’s devices and out of the reach of governments and companies.

In doing so, Apple made a loud statement: mass data collection and invasive advertising don’t have to be the status quo online and consumer privacy should be a significant factor in the online advertising equation. It's a refreshing take that we support.</p>

This let companies get around Firefox’s built-in third-party cookie-blocking policy, by sending people through the tracker’s site before landing on their desired website, tracking their moves along the way. It's sneaky, privacy-invading and just plain rude. And we put an end to it with Firefox's ETP 2.0, our latest step in providing the safe and private experience our users expect from Mozilla.</p>

  			<p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">In July, we launched Mozilla VPN, a service that people can trust to keep their connection to the internet safe and private on all their devices. While the VPN market is full of options for consumers, we saw two opportunities: 1) consumer demand for a truly trustworthy VPN and 2) our continued expansion into paid products.</p>
  			<p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">We adhere to easy, no-nonsense Data Privacy Principles,which means we're not sucking up user data ourselves, as some VPNs do. And since we are mission-driven, consumers can trust that the dollars spent for Mozilla VPN will not only ensure top-notch security, but will be put to work making the internet better for everyone.</p>

  			<p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">Back in 2017, we overhauled our desktop browser with the launch of Firefox Quantum. Building on that success, we turned to our mobile browsers. In August of 2020, we proudly launched a completely overhauled Firefox for Android, a faster, more private and independent browser for Android fans.</p>
  			<p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">Unlike other Android browsers, such as Chrome, Edge and Brave, this new Firefox is built from Mozilla’s own independent technology, giving us complete freedom to set standards, develop features and keep people safe on our own terms. People who want to break free from Big Tech's consolidation need look no further. Firefox is the last truly independent browser, and it's better than ever.</p>

Some 1,500 creators showed up, and well over a hundred projects are underway. Now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/mozilla-goes-full-incubator-with-fix-the-internet-startup-lab-and-early-stage-investments/">we're continuing our experimentation by launching our v2: the Mozilla Builders Incubator</a>. We are investing in <a href="https://builders.mozilla.community/who-we-fund.html">people, projects, and technologies</a> that shape the internet and have a positive impact without having to only worry about the bottom line. It's people like that who built Firefox, and who will write the next amazing chapter of the internet.</p>
