  <h2>When allowed, how should I use a Mozilla trademark?</h2>

  <h3>General Guidelines</h3>

  <h4>Do:</h4>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

    <li>Give a Mozilla logo adequate spacing from the other elements on the web page or document (see the <a href="#logo-guidelines">Mozilla Logo and Firefox Logo Guidelines</a> below).</li>

    <li>
      {% trans list=url('foundation.trademarks.list') %}Use the Mozilla trademark exactly as shown in the <a href="{{ list }}">Trademarks List</a>.{% endtrans %}
    </li>

    <li>
      Use Mozilla wordmarks only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb. Do not use them in plural or possessive forms.
      <ul>
        <li>Instead, use the generic term for the Mozilla product or service following the trademark.</li>
        <li>For example: Firefox web browser, Pocket app.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Include a trademark attribution notice.
      <ul>
        <li>{% trans list=url('foundation.trademarks.list') %}Use a clearly visible notice to provide attribution to Mozilla, such as: “[Mozilla trademark] is a trademark of the Mozilla Foundation in the US and other countries.” Please see the <a href="{{ list }}">Trademarks List</a> for examples of attribution notices.{% endtrans %}</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Don’t:</h4>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

    <li>Don’t use Mozilla trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.</li>

    <li>Don’t use marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly similar to Mozilla trademarks.</li>

    <li>Don’t use Mozilla trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Mozilla of your products or services.</li>

    <li>Don’t display Mozilla trademarks more prominently than your product, service, or company name.</li>

    <li>Don’t use Mozilla trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.)</li>

    <li>Don’t use Mozilla trademarks for any other form of commercial use (e.g. offering technical support services), unless such use is limited to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g. “Independent technical support for Mozilla’s Firefox browser”).</li>

    <li>Don’t modify Mozilla’s trademarks, abbreviate them, or combine them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporate them into a tagline or slogan.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Additional Guidelines</h3>

  <h4>Software Distribution Guidelines</h4>

  <p>{% trans distribution=url('foundation.trademarks.distribution-policy') %} Our <a href="{{ distribution }}">distribution policy</a> contains additional guidelines that apply to distribution of the Firefox Browser and other Mozilla software.{% endtrans %} </p>

  <h4 id="logo-guidelines">Mozilla Logo and Firefox Logo Guidelines</h4>

  <p>If your use of a logo is permitted under the General Guidelines above, then please refer to the Mozilla Style Guide for detailed information on proper usage.</p>

  <p>Mozilla Logo: <a href="https://mozilla.design/mozilla/logo-usage/">https://mozilla.design/mozilla/logo-usage/</a></p>

  <p>Firefox Logo: <a href="https://design.firefox.com/photon/visuals/product-identity-assets.html">https://design.firefox.com/photon/visuals/product-identity-assets.html</a></p>

  <h4 id="firefox-add-on">Firefox Add-on Guidelines</h4>

  <p>{% trans %}In addition to the General Guidelines above, your add-on developer name and everything about your add-on (including the add-on name, icon, description, graphics and screenshots) must be unique and free of Mozilla trademarks unless (1) you’ve received prior written permission from Mozilla or (2) you’re only using a Mozilla wordmark to describe that your add-on works with Firefox and as long as your add-on icon and/or name:{% endtrans %}</p>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

  <li>Does not suggest or give the impression your add-on is actually published by, affiliated with or endorsed by Mozilla; and</li>

  <li> Denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by Mozilla.</li>

  </ul>

  <p> For example, you cannot name your add-on “Firefox NewGadget Extension”.  However, it would be acceptable to name your add-on "NewGadget Extension for Firefox”.</p>

  <h4 id="social-media">Social Media Guidelines</h4>

  <p>{% trans %}In addition to the General Guidelines above, the name and handle of your social media account and any and all pages cannot begin with a Mozilla trademark. In addition, Mozilla logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with Mozilla, including, but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exception to these requirements is if you’ve received prior permission from Mozilla.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community “Firefox Representatives” or “Mozilla Software.” However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community “Fans of Firefox” or “Information about Mozilla Software” as long as you do not use the Firefox or Mozilla logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with Mozilla.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h4 id="open-source-guidelines">Open Source Project Guidelines</h4>

  <p>{% trans %}The specific license for each of Mozilla’s software products and code says what you can and cannot do with the code itself but does not give permission to use Mozilla’s trademarks. If you choose to build on or modify Mozilla’s open source code for your own project,{% endtrans %}</p>
  <h4>You Must:</h4>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
  
    <li>Follow the terms of the Open Source License(s) for Mozilla software products and code.</li>

    <li>Choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by Mozilla.</li>

    <li>Follow the General Guidelines, above.</li>
  
  </ul>

  <h4>You Must NOT:</h4>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

    <li>Use any Mozilla trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.</li>

    <li>Use any Mozilla trademark or any part of any Mozilla trademark to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your software is actually published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by Mozilla.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>For example, please do not name your project, [Something]-fox, Moz-[Something], or [Something]-zilla. </p>

    </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>You May:</h4>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">

    <li>State in words (not using logos or images) that your product “works with” or “is compatible” with certain Mozilla software products, if that is true. </li>

    <li>State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on Mozilla open source technology, if that is true, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with Mozilla or its products. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="lead-in" >For instance, you may state that your project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“is proudly built from Mozilla’s open source GeckoView software”</li>
        <li>“adapted from Mozilla’s open source Boot2Gecko”</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p class="lead-in" >as long as you also include the statement equally prominently: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“[Brand Name] and [Product Name] are not officially associated with Mozilla or its products.”</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Cloud-based Services</h4>

  <p>If you offer a cloud-based service that provides remote access to Mozilla software, it is important that you do so in a way that does not confuse users about who is offering the service. You must not use Mozilla trademarks in the name of your product or service. </>

  <p>You may state in words (not using logos or images) that your product or service features or provides access to unaltered Mozilla software, if this is true.

  <p class="lead-in" >For example: </p>

  <p class="lead-in" >Acceptable: [Your Product Name] featuring Mozilla’s Firefox browser</p>

  <p>Incorrect: Firefox [Your Product Name]</p>

  <h4>Mozilla Community Guidelines</h4>

  <p>{% trans discourse=("https://discourse.mozilla.org/") %}Various permissions to use Mozilla Trademarks have been provided to various members of the Mozilla Community, and these Mozilla Trademark Guidelines do not alter any such previously granted permissions.{% endtrans %}</p>
