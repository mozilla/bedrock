    This was the page for the Community Editions Policy.  However, after
    <a href="{{ discussion }}">some discussion</a>,
    it was clear the program needs were being
    addressed elsewhere and the cost outweighed the utility. As of April 7, 2009,
    new builds are no longer authorized under the Community
    Edition program.

          We have an established localization (“l10n”) program with more support
          and infrastructure to help our localizers.
          Under the <a href="{{ l10n }}">l10n program</a>
          the localized versions of our products are easier to create so
          the community rarely uses Community Edition builds for this purpose.

        We believe that the above provide options for you to distribute customized version of our products, while allowing us to ensure the quality

  builds contained unknown additional software or were based on out-dated versions of our product.

        Any Community Editions builds created and distributed prior to April 7, 2009, and making the
        <a href="{{ changes }}">permitted changes</a>,
        may continue to be distributed and call themselves “Community
        Edition.” For these existing builds, there is no change to the long standing policy:
      {% endtrans %}</p>

      <ul>
        <li>{% trans %}If it is a Community Edition of Mozilla Firefox or Thunderbird and you want to use the name Firefox of Thunderbird, it must use the names
        “Firefox Community Edition” or “Thunderbird Community Edition” to identify the software.  The words “Community Edition” may be translated. {% endtrans %}</li>

        <li>{% trans %}These builds cannot be branded and distributed as “Mozilla Firefox,” may not use the Mozilla name or trademarked Mozilla logos, and must be
        identified as Community Editions. For example, “Mozilla Firefox Community Edition” is not allowed.{% endtrans %}</li>

        <li>{% trans %}We may require individuals or teams to stop distributing these builds in the future if they are redistributing software with low quality and
        efforts to remedy the situation have not succeeded.{% endtrans %}</li>
