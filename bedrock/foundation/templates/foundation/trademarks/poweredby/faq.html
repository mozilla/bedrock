      <p>{% trans %}Making a Powered by Mozilla logo available will demonstrate
        how broadly Mozilla's technology is being adopted and will help
        the community get a better understanding of who the users of Mozilla
        technology are.  Getting a wide range of applications
        identified with this program can also be the first step in bringing more
        people into the community as active contributors.{% endtrans %}</p>

      <p>{% trans %}There are unavoidable legal requirements that need to be dealt
        with when working with a trademark.  We need to ensure that
        use of the mark is licensed and/or used with permission. Any license must
        also have a quality component, meaning the
        products which bear a trademark must meet certain standards determined by
        the trademark owner. The mark should also not be
        used in connection with products or services that are illegal, offensive,
        malicious, or harmful as such uses tarnish the
        Mozilla brand. These terms may seem subjective, but the gist should be
        clear.{% endtrans %}</p>

      <p>{% trans %}The trademark holder ultimately has the right to determine
        when and how the marks may be used, solely so that the
        trademarks maintain their value and function as an identifier of both
        source and quality&mdash;the essence of a trademark.
        Thus, letting anyone use a trademark, at their own discretion, without
        precondition, renders the trademark meaningless and
        is not a viable option.  Certainly unauthorized use of trademarks may
        sometimes occur, but that's a different issue.{% endtrans %}</p>

      <p>{% trans %}In addition, any program we create should not result in a
        certification mark, like the Underwriters Laboratory UL mark,
        where anyone who meets a defined set of tests may use the UL mark for any
        purpose and where the brand owner is actually
        forbidden from using the UL mark for its own products.{% endtrans %}</p>

    <dt id="who">{{ _('Who decides how the guidelines are applied?') }}</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>{% trans %}A representative of the Mozilla Foundation will review all
        applications to make sure that no use of the Powered by Mozilla
        logo would harm, dilute, or jeopardize the Mozilla brand as a whole or
        make the Mozilla brand meaningless.{% endtrans %}</p>

    <dd>
      <p>{% trans manifesto=url('mozorg.about.manifesto') %}
        The <a href="{{ manifesto }}">Mozilla Manifesto</a>
        sets out a set of values that are central to
        the Mozilla community's activities.  A values-focused program could
        demonstrate how broadly the principles of the Mozilla
        Manifesto are being adopted and could bring this message to new groups of
        people.  While promoting the values of the
        Mozilla Manifesto is a worthwhile effort, we believe that trying to
        promote both technologies and values with the Powered
        by Mozilla logo is impossible for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>it would be confusing to make one mark mean two very different things.</li>
          <li>it could potentially be very divisive to create guidelines that
            would require us to turn down someone's request to use the logo for an
            application that uses XULRunner (for example) but doesn't advance the
            principles of the Manifesto.</li>
          <li>the phrase "Powered by" implies a technology, so this logo wouldn't
            lend itself to use by organizations or individuals that support the
            Manifesto in ways that don't involve our technology (e.g. hosting
            events that spread the idea of an open Internet to people in the
            developing world).</li>
