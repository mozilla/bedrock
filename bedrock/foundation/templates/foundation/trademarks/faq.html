    <dd>{% trans policy=url('foundation.trademarks.policy'), styleurl=url('styleguide.index') %}
      This document sets out to answer, beyond what's in the
      <a href="{{ policy }}">trademark policy</a>, common questions which
      arise about the use of the Mozilla Trademarks and Logos. Our code
      is free, but we do strictly enforce our trademark rights, we must,
      in order to keep them valid.  This means that, while you have
      considerable freedom to redistribute and modify our software,
      there are tight restrictions on your ability to use the Mozilla
      name and logos, even when built into binaries that we provide. When in doubt,
      please review our <a href="{{ styleurl }}">style guide</a>.

    <dd>
      <p>{% trans list=url('foundation.trademarks.list') %}
          We have <a href="{{ list }}">a list</a>.{% endtrans %}</p>

      <p>{% trans %}The default logos in CVS which are built into Firefox
        and Thunderbird by default (i.e. the globe without the fox, and
        the original blue bird) are explicitly
        <span class="underline">not</span> protected
        as Mozilla trademarks. The files themselves are available under
        the mozilla.org tri-license; you can do anything you like with
        them under those terms.

      <p>{% trans %}(The cute green dinosaur is not a Mozilla Foundation trademark either; its legal status is unclear, and we are moving away from using it.){% endtrans %}</p>

    <dt>{% trans %}What about "Gecko"?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>{% trans %}Gecko&reg; is a registered trademark of Netscape Communications Corporation.
      Netscape/AOL has licensed the trademark to the Foundation for use in describing
      our layout engine.{% endtrans %}</p>

    <dt>{% trans %}Can I distribute any of the Mozilla software from my website, by CD, or to my friends, employees or students?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>{% trans binaries=url('firefox'), mpl='/MPL/' %}<strong>If you are redistributing unchanged
        <a href="{{ binaries }}">official stable binaries</a>
        downloaded from mozilla.org, to anyone in any way and for any
        purpose, no further permissions are required from us.</strong>
        We request that you
        distribute the latest stable version (and of course, we believe that it's
        in your best interest to do so as well). The notification requirements of the
        <a href="{{ mpl }}" title="Mozilla Public License">MPL</a>
        have been met for our binaries, so although it's a good idea, you
        are not required to ship source code.
      {% endtrans %}</p>

      <p>{% trans %}If you want to distribute one of our products and this
        answer does not apply to you, please say so explicitly in your
        <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Marketing&amp;format=trademark">trademark use request</a>,
        because otherwise you'll just get pointed at this FAQ entry :-)

    <dt>{% trans %}Can I download one copy and install it on lots of machines in my company/school/university/pizzeria?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans free="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html",

        Sure. Our products are
        <a href="{{ free }}">Free software</a>,
        both as in speech and as in beer, and there are no fees or notification
        requirements. If you plan to reconfigure it and then sell the machines,
        we do have
        <a href="{{ policy }}">a policy about that</a>.

    <dt>{% trans %}Can I put Firefox banners on my website? Can I link to you?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans styleguide=url('styleguide.index') %}
    Thanks for your support :-) Of course you may. Our <a href="{{ styleguide }}">style guide</a> has additional assets you may need: {% endtrans %}<br />

        <li>
          <a href="{{ url('styleguide.index') }}">{{ _('Firefox logo') }}</a>

      </ul>

    <dt>{% trans %}What about use of screenshots etc.?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans %}Approval is not required for the following fair uses of the Mozilla marks:
    {% endtrans %}
      <ol>
        <li>{% trans %}screenshots of our software or our web site in magazine articles or reviews of our software{% endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans %}the inclusion of Mozilla browser windows in screenshots of other web sites for non-commercial uses such as web site reviews{% endtrans %}</li>
        <li>{% trans %}on-screen displays of Mozilla products in television programs or movies.{% endtrans %}</li>
      </ol>
      {% trans %}You may also use screenshots of Mozilla products in commercial books and publications, both where the products are the focus and where they are not (e.g. screenshots of web pages or emails).
      {% endtrans %}
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Can I have high-resolution copies of the logos?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans %}In general, no, sorry. If you have a very good reason,
      e.g. you are a print publication wanting to
      feature Firefox on the cover, contact the Visual Identity Team.
    {% endtrans %}</dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Can I make a t-shirt/desktop wallpaper/baseball cap with the logo on?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd><p>{% trans %}Sure, if it's just for you, or if it's for others
        and no money or other consideration changes hands (although see
        the question about high-res versions).
    {% endtrans %}</p></dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Can I modify your logos and distribute the result?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>{% trans %}Please don't. The logos are trademarked, and so if the result is confusingly similar to the original, or used in a confusing manner, it's a violation of trademark law.{% endtrans %}</dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Doesn't having trademark restrictions contravene the principles of free software?
    {% endtrans %}</dt>

    <dd>{% trans %}No. Many free software licenses explicitly exclude rights to trademarks, and so trademark restrictions on otherwise free software is accepted by the community. We are using our trademarks as a mark of quality to protect consumers - we think this is very much within the principles of free software.
    {% endtrans %}</dd>
