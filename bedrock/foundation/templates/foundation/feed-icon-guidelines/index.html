      The feed icon <em>should</em> be used to indicate the presence
      of information provided via web syndication in an open format,
      including in particular the widely-used
      <a href="{{ rss }}">RSS 1.0</a>,

      By <q>web syndication</q> we mean a process in which content
      items from a web site or other source (e.g., news stories or blog
      posts or summaries thereof) are made available for other sites or
      applications to use, typically using an
      <a href="{{ xml }}">XML</a>-based document format

        <li>free of legal restrictions on use, especially restrictions
        that would prevent the format from being implemented by free and

        <li>developed and/or maintained through an open process</li>
      </ul>

  <p>{% trans %}The canonical use of the feed icon is on a web page containing
  information (such as blog posts, news articles, and so on) that is
  also made available via web syndication, with the icon linking to
  a URL for the web feed.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}The feed icon <em>may</em> be used in other contexts that
  involve discovery, retrieval, reading, creation, or manipulation
  of information in open web syndication formats. For example, the
  icon <em>may</em> be used as (or incorporated as part of) a menu
  icon or toolbar icon invoking particular features of an
  application or online service that are related to open web
  syndication formats.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <div class="para">
    {% trans %}
      <p>The feed icon (or confusingly-similar variants of it)
      <em>should not</em> be used in the following contexts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in relation to information that is not made available in
        open web syndication formats;</li>

        <li>as, or incorporated as part of, an application icon, a web
        site logo (including a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a>),
        or in any other way that would imply to a casual observer that
        the feed icon was exclusively or primarily associated with a
        particular application or web site; or</li>

        <li>as, or incorporated as part of, a trademark or service mark
        associated with a particular individual, organization, product,
        or service, or in any other way that would imply to a casual
        observer that the feed icon was exclusively or primarily

        or service.</li>

  <p>{% trans %}Note that these guidelines are <em>not</em> intended to
  preclude in any way making fair use of the feed icon, including
  using the icon in connection with blog posts, news stories,
  magazine articles, books, television programs, movies, or other
  works discussing open web syndication formats or applications or
  web sites supporting such formats.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <h2>{{ _('Visual guidelines') }}</h2>

  <p>{% trans %}The feed icon <em>should</em> be displayed in its entirety on
  either a solid light or dark background (avoid mid-tone or
  strongly colored backgrounds). The feed icon <em>should not</em>
  be displayed in parts or with other elements superimposed on top
  of the icon.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}The feed icon <em>should</em> be displayed at a size that is
  both large enough to render it legible to its intended users and
  compatible with the size of any related text elements.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}The feed icon <em>may</em> be displayed using the colors black
  and white in contexts where color reproduction is not
  possible. The feed icon <em>may</em> be used with the colors of
  the icon inverted (e.g., white used instead of orange and vice
  versa), as long as there is adequate contrast between the
  background and foreground colors.{% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>{% trans %}When used as an element in a user interface (e.g., as a toolbar
  button) the feed icon <em>should</em> be displayed in a manner
  consistent with related UI elements and any applicable user
  interface standards (e.g., for the underlying operating system
  and/or window system).{% endtrans %}</p>

  <div class="para">{% trans %}<p>The feed icon <em>should not</em> be
  displayed in modified forms inconsistent with the above guidelines
  or in ways that visually compromise the icon. In particular, the
  icon <em>should not</em >be displayed</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in a different orientation (i.e., rotated or flipped
    relative to the standard orientation)</li>

    <li>with the <q>rounded square</q> element of the icon replaced
    by a circle, triangle, or any shape other than that used on the
    original background</li>

    <li>with the corners of the <q>rounded square</q> element of the
    icon made sharp rather than rounded.</li>
  </ul>{% endtrans %}</div>

  <p>{% trans %}Note that the above guidelines regarding size and color are
  <em>not</em> intended to restrict the ways in which the feed icon
  might be represented by assistive technologies designed for use by
  people with impaired vision. (Such technologies include software
  to magnify the contents of the screen and/or change screen colors,
  contrast, and brightness; alternative stylesheets for web sites;
  and the like.){% endtrans %}</p>

  <p>
    {% trans feeds="http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/" %}
      Note also that these guidelines are <em>not</em> intended to
      discourage other uses of the feed icon that conform to the overall
      spirit of these guidelines. Such cases include using different
      colors for the icon where appropriate (e.g., in matching a site
      theme) or using the icon in combination with other icons of a
      compatible style and nature (e.g.,
      <a href="{{ feeds }}" title="NYTimes.com RSS feeds">to
      identify the type of feed being offered</a>).
      However in the interests of providing a consistent experience for
      users we suggest that providers of feed readers and related goods
      and services make minimum use of such alternative representations
      of the icon.
