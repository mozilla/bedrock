  You may use the HTML and CSS files on www.mozilla.org or other mozilla.org
  websites for your web site - as long as you don't use the visual design or
  style (the colors, gradients, fonts, etc.).  In other words, you can use
  the HTML and/or CSS code, but it should not look like you took our page
  and dropped in your logo.
