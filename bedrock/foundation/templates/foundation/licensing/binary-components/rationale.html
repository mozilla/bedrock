      The Microsoft D3DCompiler DLL is an example of an application of the
      <a href="{{ binary }}">binary components</a> policy. To provide a good
      <a href="{{ webgl }}">WebGL</a> experience to Windows users with
      Intel graphics cards we planned on shipping <a href="{{ angle }}">ANGLE</a>,
      an open source library, which translates WebGL/OpenGL to Direct3D.
      However, one of the pieces that ANGLE depends on is the D3DCompiler
      library provided by Microsoft. This library is not available in default
      Windows installs before Windows 8.1. Microsoft permits either the
      creation of a separate installer that all Windows users would need to
      execute when installing Firefox (which would increase download time and
      complexity and be a poor user experience), or bundling the required DLL
      with the product (as we have chosen to do). The Intel graphics cards
      are estimated to represent 50% of the graphic cards market; thus it’s
      a relevant portion of users. In addition, the D3DCompiler library also
      supports the long term adoption of WebGL as an open standard for 3D
      rendering on the web.
