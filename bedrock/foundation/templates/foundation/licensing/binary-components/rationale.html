  <h2>Direct 3D DLL</h2>

      The Microsoft D3D9X DLL is an example of an application of the
      <a href="{{ binary }}">binary components</a> policy. To provide a good
      <a href="{{ webgl }}">WebGL</a> experience to Windows users with
      Intel graphics cards we planned on shipping <a href="{{ angle }}">ANGLE</a>,
      an open source library,  which translates WebGL/OpenGL to Direct3D 9.
      However, one of the pieces that ANGLE depends on is the D3D9X library
      provided by Microsoft. This library is not available in default
      Windows installs. Microsoft permits either the creation of a
      2.5-3MB separate installer that all Windows users would need to
      execute when installing Firefox (which would increase download
      time and complexity and be a poor user experience), or bundling
      the required 800k DLL with the product (as we have chosen to do).
      The Intel graphics cards are estimated to represent 50% of the
      graphic cards market; thus it’s a relevant portion of users.
      In addition, the D3D9X library also supports the long term
      adoption of WebGL as an open standard for 3D rendering on the web.
