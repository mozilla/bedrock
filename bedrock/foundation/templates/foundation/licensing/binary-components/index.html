{% block article_content %}
  <p>Mozilla is and remains irrevocably committed to making
      free and open source software. We see this as the best way to advance
      our mission of preserving and promoting the open web. However, we also
      design and distribute our products to operate on both free and non-free,
      proprietary platforms with the goal of reaching as many users as
      reasonably possible.  Developing products on non-free, proprietary
      platforms will often involve the use of OS vendor SDKs and other tools
      to develop for those platforms.  In some cases, proprietary, non-free
      operating systems do not always contain all of the operating system
      components necessary for proper performance of our products and/or
      the SDKs impose terms that are inconsistent with our existing licenses.
  </p>

  <p>When this occurs we may, under some circumstances, decide
      to include additional OS vendor code with the installer of our
      products designed for the proprietary platform to make our products
      work well on that specific operating system.  This means some code
      included with the installer of our products on non-free platforms
      may be governed by licenses other than the Mozilla Public License.
      Binary versions of our products are distributed under the MPL,
      which allows bundling of proprietary code.  Of course those who wish
      to compile the code without these components can do so from the
      source code repository. We believe this approach is consistent with
      other Linux distribution practices that may include binary elements,
      most notably drivers, and firmware support for network devices.
  </p>

  <p>Some of the key factors in making such a decision include:
  </p>

  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li>Whether the code provides OS level functionality that would
        normally be in the OS or which we have reason to believe will be
        there in the future;
    </li>

    <li>The code is provided by the OS vendor or a trusted
        3rd party;
    </li>

    <li>Whether alternatives exist that provide a comparable
        user experience;
    </li>

    <li>The terms under which the OS level code is available;
        and
    </li>

    <li>Whether the inclusion of the code provides significant
        and important functionality for developers and/or users.
    </li>
  </ul>

      We will indicate in <tt>about:license</tt> whether any such code
      of this type is included in products designed for non-free platforms.
