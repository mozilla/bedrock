  <h2>{{ _('Trademarks') }}</h2>
  <p>
    {% trans %}
    Although our code is free, it is very important that we strictly enforce our trademark rights, in order to be able to protect our users against people who use the marks to commit fraud. This means that, while you have considerable freedom to redistribute and modify our software, there are tight restrictions on your ability to use the Mozilla names and logos in ways which fall in the domain of trademark law, even when built into binaries that we provide.
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans trademarks=url('foundation.trademarks.policy'), email="mailto:trademark-permissions@mozilla.com"%}
    For more detail on our trademark licensing, see our <a href="{{ trademarks }}">Mozilla Trademark Guidelines</a>. If you still have questions after reading the policy, please contact <a href="{{ email }}">trademark-permissions@mozilla.com</a>.

      You may use the HTML and CSS files on www.mozilla.org or other
      mozilla.org websites for your web site - as long as you don't use
      the visual design or style (the colors, gradients, fonts, etc.).
      In other words, you can use the HTML and/or CSS code, but your
      page should not look like you took Mozilla's page and dropped in
      your logo. This does not grant you any right to use the trademarks,
      trade names, service marks, or trade dress of the Mozilla Foundation.

  <h2>{{ _('Executable Software') }}</h2>
  <p>
    {% trans

    %}
      Executable software binaries released by the Mozilla Project, such
      as Firefox and Thunderbird, are made available under the terms of the
      MPL. On some proprietary, non-free platforms, necessary binary components
      subject to other licenses may be included in the installer, as explained
      <a href="{{ binary }}">in this policy</a>.
    {% endtrans %}

  <h2>{{ _('Informative, Not Authoritative') }}</h2>
  <p>
    {% trans %}
      This page is designed to inform, not to be the final, authoritative
      reference. If you're looking to reuse or redistribute something
      Mozilla has created, always check the licensing in the thing
      itself (for example, in the footer of a web page, or in the "About"
      box of software) after you've looked at this document.
    {% endtrans %}

      In case of a conflict between this document and other documents (for
      example, if this document and the header file of a particular
      source code file conflict) the other document should take
      precedence. If you do discover such a conflict, please notify
      <a href="{{ email }}">licensing@mozilla.org</a> so we can fix it.

      If, after reading all the above carefully, you have a further
      question about the licensing terms of anything created by the
      Mozilla project, please send the question to
      <a href="{{ email }}">licensing@mozilla.org</a>.
