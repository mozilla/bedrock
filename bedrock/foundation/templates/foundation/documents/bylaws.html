<p>Section 1. Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held at such place and at such time as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. If the annual meeting of the shareholders be not held as herein prescribed, the election of directors may be held at any meeting thereafter called pursuant to these Bylaws.</p>

Special meetings of the shareholders, for any purpose whatsoever, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, the President, or by the Board of Directors, or by one or more shareholders holding not less than ten percent of the voting power of the Corporation.</p>
<p>Section 3. Place. All meetings of the shareholders shall be at any place within or without the State of California designated by the Board of Directors or by written consent of all the persons entitled to vote thereat, given either before or after the meeting. In the absence of any such designation, shareholders’ meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.</p>
<p>Section 4. Notice. Notice of meetings of the shareholders of the Corporation shall be given in writing to each shareholder entitled to vote, either personally or by first-class mail (unless the Corporation has 500 or more shareholders determined as provided by the General Corporation Law of the State of California on the record date for the meeting, in which case notice may be sent by third-class mail) or other means of written communication, charges prepaid, addressed to the shareholder at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation or given by the shareholder to the Corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice of any such meeting of shareholders shall be sent to each shareholder entitled thereto not less than ten (or, if sent by third-class mail, thirty) nor more than sixty days before the meeting. Said notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting and, (1) in the case of special meetings, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of annual meetings, those matters which the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to present for action by the shareholders, but subject to Section 601(f) of the General Corporation Law of the State of California any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for shareholder action, and (3) in the case of any meeting at which directors are to be elected, the names of the nominees intended at the time of the mailing of the notice to be presented by management for election.</p>
<p>Section 5. Adjourned Meetings. Any shareholders’ meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting shares present at the meeting either in person or by proxy. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given unless a meeting is adjourned for forty-five days or more from the date set for the original meeting. </p>
<p>Section 6. Quorum. The presence in person or by proxy of the persons entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The shareholders present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum. </p>
<p>In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of shareholders may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided above.</p>
<p>Section 7. Shareholder Action by Written Consent. Any action which may be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that (1) unless the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in writing, notice of any shareholder approval without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given as required by the General Corporation Law of the State of California, and (2) directors may not be elected by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.</p>
<p>Any written consent may be revoked by a writing received by the Secretary of the Corporation prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary.</p>
<p>Section 8. Waiver of Notice. The transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as though at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, or a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents, or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.</p>
<p>Section 9. Voting. The voting at all meetings of shareholders need not be by ballot, but any qualified shareholder before the voting begins may demand a stock vote whereupon such stock vote shall be taken by ballot, each of which shall state the name of the shareholder voting and the number of shares voted by such shareholder, and if such ballot be cast by a proxy, it shall also state the name of such proxy.</p>
<p>At any meeting of the shareholders, every shareholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy appointed in a writing subscribed by such shareholder and bearing a date not more than eleven months prior to said meeting, unless the writing states that it is irrevocable and satisfies Section 705(e) of the General Corporation Law of the State of California, in which event it is irrevocable for the period specified in said writing and said Section 705(e).</p>
<p>Section 10. Record Dates. In the event the Board of Directors fixes a day for the determination of shareholders of record entitled to vote as provided in Section 1 of Article VII of these Bylaws, then, subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of California, only persons in whose name shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on such day shall be entitled to vote.</p>
<p>If no record date is fixed:</p>
<p>The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held;</p>
<p>The record date for determining shareholders entitled to give consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent is given; and</p>
<p>The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto, or the 60th day prior to the date of such other action, whichever is later.</p>
<p>A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than 45 days.</p>
<p>Section 11. Cumulative Voting for Election of Directors. Provided the candidate’s name has been placed in nomination prior to the voting and one or more shareholders has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the shareholder’s intent to cumulate the shareholder’s votes, every shareholder entitled to vote at any election for directors shall have the right to cumulate such shareholder’s votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the shareholder’s shares are normally entitled, or distribute the shareholder’s votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the shareholder shall think fit. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares are elected.</p>
<h2>Article IV - BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h2>
<p>Section 1. Powers. Subject to any limitations in the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws and to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of California requiring shareholder authorization or approval for a particular action, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by, or under the direction of, the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may delegate the management of the day-to-day operation of the business of the Corporation to a management company or other person provided that the business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised, under the ultimate direction of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Section 2. Number, Tenure and Qualifications. The number of directors that shall constitute the whole board shall be not more than seven (7) nor fewer than two (2). The exact number of directors may be fixed from time to time within such limit by a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors or shareholders. The exact number of directors presently authorized shall be three (3) until changed within the limits specified above by a duly adopted resolution of the Board of Directors or shareholders. Directors need not be shareholders.</p>
<p>Directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors are elected. If any such annual meeting is not held, or the directors are not elected thereat, the directors may be elected at any special meeting of shareholders held for that purpose.</p>
<p>Section 3. Regular Meetings. A regular annual meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this Bylaw immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders. The Board of Directors may provide for other regular meetings from time to time by resolution.</p>
<p>Section 4. Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, or the President or any Vice President, or the Secretary or any two directors. Written notice of the time and place of all special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be delivered personally or by telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic means to each director at least forty-eight hours before the meeting, or sent to each director by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least four days before the meeting. Such notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting. Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of notice, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting prior thereto or at its commencement, the lack of notice to such director.</p>
<p>Section 5. Place of Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any place within or without the State of California, which has been designated in the notice, or if not stated in the notice or there is no notice, the principal executive office of the Corporation or as designated by the resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Section 6. Participation by Telephone. Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone, electronic video screen communication, or other communications equipment. Participation in a meeting through use of conference telephone constitutes presence in person at the meeting as long as all members participating in such meeting can hear one another. Participation in a meeting through the use of electronic video screen communication or other communications equipment (other than conference telephone) constitutes presence in person at that meeting if all of the following apply: (a) each member participating in the meeting can communicate with all of the other members concurrently, (b) each member is provided the means of participating in all matters before the Board of Directors, including, without limitation, the capacity to propose, or to interpose an objection to, a specific action to be taken by the Corporation, and (c) the Corporation adopts and implements some means of verifying that (i) a person participating in the meeting is a director or other person entitled to participate in the Board of Directors’ meeting, and (ii) all actions of, or votes by, the Board of Directors are taken or cast only by the directors and not by persons who are not directors.</p>
<p>Section 7. Quorum. A majority of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum at all meetings. In the absence of a quorum a majority of the directors present may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. If a meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the reconvened meeting to the directors who were not present at the time of adjournment.</p>
<p>Section 8. Action at Meeting. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the Board of Directors. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for such meeting. </p>
<p>Section 9. Waiver of Notice. The transactions of any meeting of the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum is present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to holding the meeting, or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.</p>
<p>Section 10. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Board. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of such directors.</p>
<p>Section 11. Removal. The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court or who has been convicted of a felony.</p>
<p>The entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed from office without cause by a vote of shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that unless the entire Board is removed, no individual director may be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes cast were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director’s most recent election were then being elected.</p>
<p>In the event an office of a director is so declared vacant or in case the Board or any one or more directors be so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting.</p>
<p>Section 12. Resignations. Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors of the Corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective. </p>
<p>Section 13. Vacancies. Except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, all vacancies in the Board of Directors, whether caused by resignation, death or otherwise, may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (a) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (b) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice complying with General Corporation Law of the State of California Section 307, or (c) a sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office until his successor is elected at an annual, regular or special meeting of the shareholders. Vacancies created by the removal of a director may be filled only by approval of the shareholders. The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors. Any such election by written consent requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.</p>
<p>Section 14. Compensation. No stated salary shall be paid directors, as such, for their services, but, by resolution of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, may be allowed for attendance at each regular or special meeting of such Board; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.</p>
<p>Section 15. Committees. The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the authorized number of directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. The appointment of members or alternate members of a committee requires the vote of a majority of the authorized number of directors. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have all the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, except with respect to (a) the approval of any action requiring shareholders’ approval or approval of the outstanding shares, (b) the filling of vacancies on the Board or any committee, (c) the fixing of compensation of directors for serving on the Board or any committee, (d) the adoption, amendment or repeal of Bylaws, (e) the amendment or repeal of any resolution of the Board which by its express terms is not so amendable or repealable, (f) a distribution to shareholders, except at a rate or in a periodic amount or within a price range determined by the Board, and (g) the appointment of other committees of the Board or the members thereof. </p>

The record date so fixed shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days prior to the date of the meeting or event for the purposes of which it is fixed. When a record date is so fixed, only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting or to receive the dividend, distribution, or allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after the record date.</p>
