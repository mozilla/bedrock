    <dt>{% trans %}What was Mozilla’s total revenue for 2007?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}Mozilla’s revenues (including both Mozilla Foundation and
    Mozilla Corporation) for 2007 were $75 million, up approximately 12%
    from 2006 revenue of $67 million.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}How does Mozilla generate revenue?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}The vast majority of this revenue is associated with the search
    functionality in Mozilla Firefox, and the majority of that is from
    Google.  Mozilla takes in additional revenue from online affiliate
    programs, the Mozilla Store, and interest and other income on our
    invested assets.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Mozilla doesn’t have a stock ticker to follow.  How do you
    measure success?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}We measure success by examining factors that reflect our growth
    such as community code contributions, localizations, market share, the
    number of nightly testers, and total users.  We are committed to
    promoting openness and participation on the Internet and demonstrating
    that the Open Web is the most fundamental platform for ongoing
    development.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Why is the growth in your claimed user base is not reflected in
    revenue growth?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}This is because search revenue increased at a lesser rate than
    Firefox usage growth as the rate of payment declines with
    volume.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Is Mozilla poised for continued growth through 2008 and
    beyond?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}Our financial objectives are for sustainability and our basic
    structure &ndash; public benefit, non-profit &ndash; means that we can
    continue with relative stability.  We’ve been building in the
    ability to live with greatly reduced revenue for years. Mozilla has a
    significant amount of retained earnings.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}What is the status of your contract with Google?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}The agreement between Google and the Mozilla Corporation that
    accounts for the bulk of the revenue has been renewed for an
    additional three years, and is now slated to expire at the end of
    November of 2011.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Your partnership with Google accounts for over 88% of your 2007
    revenue. How does this affect your independence?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}We develop our product and technical direction as part of an open
    process unrelated to the search relationship with Google. Mozilla
    teams do collaborate with Google teams on parts of the product that
    offer Google services (i.e., the Firefox Start Page) and the services
    they provide, like anti-phishing. We do not vet our initiatives with
    Google.{% endtrans %}</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>{% trans %}Are you exploring opportunities to diversify your revenue
    stream?{% endtrans %}</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>{% trans %}Mozilla has always focused on building open products that people
    love, in ways that are participatory, and then developing revenue to
    support that work. For long-term financial viability, we will of
    course look carefully at ways to diversify our revenue mix over
    time. It’s an important concept, although our current contract
    with Google gives us a firm base for the next three years. We’ll
    continue to build great products that help people enjoy the richness
    of the Internet, and we’re confident that this allows us to
    identify appropriate sources of revenue diversification.{% endtrans %}</p>
