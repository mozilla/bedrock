    The Mozilla Corporation's senior executive team is known as the
    Steering Committee.    The Steering Committee is responsible for
    leadership, coordination among the various groups working together
    to produce Mozilla's consumer products.    The Steering Committee
    stays abreast of market conditions, charts Mozilla's path through this
    environment,  and sets the direction of Mozilla's general consumer
    product offerings.  The Steering Committee also performs traditional
    management tasks such as hiring, planning, and resource allocation.
    It does so in ways that align with Mozilla's non-profit, open-source,
    community-based identity.  The Steering Committee seeks to absorb,
    distill and reflect Mozilla community values in the exercise of its
    responsibilities.
