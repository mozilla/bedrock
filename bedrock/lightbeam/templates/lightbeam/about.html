    <h2>How the add-on works</h2>
    <p>
      Lightbeam visualizes the relationships between the sites you visit and the third parties that connect to those sites and collect data about your visit. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Using three distinct interactive graphic representations — Graph, Clock and List — Lightbeam allows you to examine individual trackers, identify where they connect to your online activity and illustrates which sites employ third party data sharing without your consent. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The default Graph view shows your relationships across the Web, with adjustable filters that allow you to visualize more types of data at a glance. The Clock view allows you to explore your browsing history over a 24-hour period. The List view provides more tools for exploring the sites and third parties that are watching you. Site preferences in the List view enable you to block sites from connecting to your Firefox browser, watch sites you’re interested in or hide sites you don’t want to see visualized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightbeam also offers an information panel that provides additional details about the site you selected and the sites it has connected to.

    <h2>The origins of Lightbeam</h2>
    <p>
      Lightbeam began in July 2011 as Collusion, a personal project by Mozilla software developer <a href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/" target="_blank">Atul Varma</a>. Inspired by the book, <i>The Filter Bubble</i>, Atul created an experimental add-on to visualize browsing behavior and data collection on the Web.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In February 2012, Gary Kovacs, Mozilla CEO at the time, introduced the Collusion add-on in a TED talk (now one of the most watched TED talks of all time) about exposing online tracking.  
    </p>
    <p>
      In September 2012, Mozilla joined forces with students at <a href="https://www.ecuad.ca/" target="_blank">Emily Carr University of Art + Design</a> to develop and implement visualizations for the add-on. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Collusion has been re-imagined as Lightbeam and will launch in the fall of 2013.

    <h2>Policy and the larger tracking narrative</h2>
    <p>
      At Mozilla, we believe that everyone should have the tools to make their own decisions about their online privacy and who collects data on them. With the Lightbeam add-on and database server, we are providing a valuable (and open) community research platform that aims to raise awareness, promote analysis and, ultimately, affect policy change in the areas of tracking and privacy. Lightbeam is one step in a larger, concerted effort by Mozilla and its partners to provide Web users with greater control and transparency of their personal data.
