    Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web. As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user.

    <h2>Tracking & privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge. That’s not okay for some. It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.  <a href="{{ url('lightbeam.about') }}"> About Lightbeam »</a>

  <div class="span6">
    <h2>Explore the database</h2>
    <p>In the Lightbeam database, you will be able to browse first and third-party connection data uploaded by donors who use the Lightbeam add-on. We’re building this crowd-sourced directory to encourage users to visualize the state of tracking as an aggregate and to examine relationships that exist on the Web.

    <p>
      After you download and install the Lightbeam add-on to Firefox, it will begin to create a real time visualization of the websites you visit and all the third parties that are also active on those pages.
