<h3>Protect your identity online with Mozilla VPN</h3>
<p>With Mozilla VPN, you can surf, stream, game, and get work done while maintaining your privacy online. Whether you’re
traveling, using public WiFi, or simply looking for more online security, we’ll always put your privacy first.</p>

<h3 class="c-section-heading">What is Mozilla VPN?</h3>
<p>A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a tool that allows you to access the internet securely wherever you are. Tools
like Mozilla VPN are available to anyone who wants to protect their connection to the internet, especially when it’s
over insecure networks like public WiFi. If you don’t want people being able to see where you’re located when you’re
online, you need a VPN. It’s even useful on a home network — without a VPN, websites and your Internet Service Provider
can see your Internet traffic, and even the sites you’re browsing.</p>

<h3 class="c-section-heading">How does Mozilla VPN work?</h3>
<p>Mozilla VPN helps protect your data online by creating a secure “tunnel” between your device and the VPN or site you’re
visiting. This “tunnel” protects you in two key ways:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
  <li>When enabled, this tunnel will encrypt the traffic — in other words, encode your activity on the Internet — between you and
  Mozilla VPN so that no one on your local WiFi can see it.</li>
  <li>It’ll handle traffic from all apps and software running on your device, so you can browse and communicate freely over a
  secure private network connection. <strong>Without a VPN, your network traffic could be monitored by someone on the same network
  as your device.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also avoid trackers with VPN. How does this help you? Well, it can help cut down on intrusive advertising — you
know, where you click a link once and all of a sudden it feels like you’re getting bombarded by ads that know everything
about you. <strong>VPN can help you cut down on that terrible advertising.</strong></p>
<p>Mozilla VPN will also hide your IP, or Internet Protocol, address, which can help hide your location and protect your
identity. A VPN provider typically offers a number of connection gateways in different locations, which allows you to
use an IP address from a location different from your own.</p>
<p>That way, whatever site or service you’re connecting to sees the VPN’s IP, not your actual IP address, as the source of
your traffic. Mozilla VPN, for example, routes your traffic through a secure server and lets you <strong>choose from more than
30 countries through which you can route your traffic.</strong></p>
<p>In short, Mozilla VPN is a tool that allows you to take back control of your online activity from corporations, hackers,
and thieves who would love to get a chance to steal your data or your identity, or otherwise compromise your online
life. By subscribing to Mozilla VPN, you’re also supporting our mission as a company to make the Internet a better place
for all:</p>
