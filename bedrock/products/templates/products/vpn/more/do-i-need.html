<h3>If you use the Internet, Mozilla VPN can make you more secure</h3>
<p>Do you use the Internet? Since you’re reading this, let’s assume you do. If you use the Internet to do anything
sensitive or personal—like checking your bank account, using social media, or shopping online — <strong>Mozilla VPN
will help you protect yourself from bad actors like hackers and online trackers.</strong> Mozilla VPN is easy to use, secure, and
is backed by our over 20-year <a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.history')}}">track record</a> of building products that put people and
privacy first, unlike other VPN providers that may sell your data.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses the Internet to do anything important or personal should use Mozilla VPN. Since public WiFi
networks are generally higher risk, it may not be not safe to use them to do things like check your Instagram or
Facebook accounts, reply to emails, or access sensitive accounts like your bank. Mozilla VPN allows anyone using almost
any device to protect their location and online traffic from being tracked or monitored.

<h3 class="c-section-heading">When would I use a VPN?</h3>
<p>Since Mozilla VPN protects the traffic of your entire device, you can flip the toggle and go about your business online,
no matter where you are. It’s that easy. Connecting to a public WiFi network can be convenient, like when you’re without internet service or can’t get any bars
on your phone. <strong>But it’s impossible to be sure that someone else isn’t connecting to the same network to snoop on what
you’re doing.</strong></p>
<p>It can also be hard to tell which public WiFi networks are legitimate, and which are “spoofs” that only appear to be
officially provided by the location or space. Mozilla VPN helps stop that kind of snooping by encrypting your online
activity, making you and the site you’re visiting the only ones able to see what you’re up to. With encryption, it is
significantly more difficult to spy on your activity.</p>
<p>When you’re at home, the risk of bad actors showing up on your home network is lower. But <strong>your internet service provider
(ISP) can track and share your online activities</strong> because all the data that you access on the web is routed through your
ISP’s network, some of which may not be encrypted. That’s why you still need a VPN even when you’re home.</p>
<p>Mozilla VPN can prevent ISPs from spying on you by encrypting your traffic — and hiding your location — no matter where you
are.</p>

<h3 class="c-section-heading">What about free VPNs?</h3>
<p>In short, free VPNs are a lot like Facebook: if you’re not paying for the product, it’s because you ARE the product.
Free VPNs may help you keep your data safe from people on local networks, but in return for the free service, they may
sell your data to companies looking to advertise to you — it’s a tradeoff that really isn’t worth it for the truly
Internet-savvy. If you value your personal data and online security, Mozilla VPN is the way to go — plus, you’re
contributing to our mission to make the Internet a safe and secure place for everyone.</p>
