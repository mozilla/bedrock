<h3>Privacy should not be optional</h3>
<p>Hiding your identity and cloaking your web traffic can seem like something only super tech-savvy people do. But
  privacy is not something that you should treat as optional — it requires vigilance and protection to keep hold of it.
  Mozilla VPN offers you security, reliability and speed on every device, wherever you are — while supporting privacy
  and security and freedom online.</p>
<p><strong><a href="{{ url('mozorg.about.manifesto') }}#principles-04">Mozilla Principle #4:</a> Individuals’ security
    and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</strong></p>

<h3 class="c-section-heading">Here’s why Mozilla VPN is the best VPN:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4 class="c-list-heading">1. It’s safe, secure, and easy to use.</h5>
      <p class="c-list-content">Having a VPN at your fingertips when you need it is a good idea. Having a VPN as simple
        to use as Mozilla VPN is even better. Just open up the app on whatever device you’re using, flip the toggle, and
        you’re ready to go. No settings to fiddle with (unless you want to!). What’s more, our service is built on the
        WireGuard® protocol — making it your most secure VPN option. In addition, your online activities stay anonymous
        because we never log or track your network activity data.</p>

        </a>
      </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4 class="c-list-heading">2. Mozilla VPN will never track you—unlike some others.</h5>
      <p class="c-list-content">The most important thing to consider when picking either a VPN or a proxy service is
        choosing a trustworthy company. Be sure you understand the terms you’re agreeing to. Many claim to be great and
        focused on privacy, but a large number of
        them fall short on their promise. Not all proxy and VPN services are secure and private. Some will log your
        online
        activities so they can sell your data and information to marketing firms themselves. Other services will try to
        convince you to install malware on your devices.</p>
      <p class="c-list-content">We’ve done the legwork to ensure that both the Mozilla VPN and Firefox Private Network
        proxy extension actually
        respect your privacy, and it’s something we’re willing to stake our reputation on. Mozilla has a reputation for
        building
        products that help you keep your information safe. We follow our easy-to-read, no-nonsense <a
          href="{{ url('privacy.principles') }}">Data Privacy Principles</a> which allow us to focus only on the
        information we need to provide a service. And since we are backed by a mission-driven company, you can trust
        that the dollars you spend for this product will not only ensure you have a top-notch security, but also are
        making the internet better for everyone.</p>
