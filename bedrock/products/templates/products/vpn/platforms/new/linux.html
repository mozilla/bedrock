<p>Linux is free, open-source, and customizable, but it’s not immune to online security and privacy issues. Just like
  users
  of other operating systems, Linux users face censorship, surveillance, and hacking.</p>
<h3>What is Mozilla VPN?</h3>
<p>Mozilla VPN is a virtual private network service that uses open-source state-of-the-art encryption and does not log,
  track or share any of your network activity. It allows you to connect to over 500 servers in 30+ countries.</p>
<h3>Why Choose Mozilla VPN for Linux?</h3>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
  <li><strong>Fast and reliable:</strong> Mozilla VPN uses the WireGuard® protocol, which offers better performance and
    stability than other
    VPN protocols</li>
  <li><strong>No logs:</strong>Mozilla VPN does not keep any logs of your network activity; we don’t record which
    websites you visit or inspect your
    traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>Additional security features:</strong>We use DNS blocking to block ads, trackers, and malware. While a
    browser can prevent only websites from giving you
    malware and tracking you.</li>
  <li><strong>Device-level encryption:</strong>Unlike VPNs that only encrypt your browser traffic, Mozilla VPN encrypts
    all your device’s traffic, including all your
    applications and games.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-hop routing:</strong>For added protection, Mozilla VPN can encrypt your traffic and route it through
    two locations instead of one, making it
    harder for anyone to trace your online activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple and intuitive interface:</strong>Connect to a server with one click. You can also customize your
    settings and preferences according to your needs.</li>
  <li><strong>It helps restore net neutrality:</strong>Mozilla VPN helps you take back control of your online activities
    by preventing internet providers from throttling your bandwidth, or from blocking websites or services that they
    don’t like, or that compete with their own offerings.</li>
  <li><strong>GUI client:</strong>Mozilla VPN has a GUI client (graphical user interface), whereas some VPN providers
    only provide a CLI version (command
    line).</li>
</ul>
<p>By using Mozilla VPN, you can take back control of your online activities and protect your privacy and data. Download
  Mozilla VPN today and enjoy a 30-day money-back guarantee with no logs, no hassle, and no risk.</p>
