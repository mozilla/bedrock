<p>If you own an iPad, you probably use it for a lot of things: browsing the web, watching videos, playing games, reading
books, and more. But whether you’re at home or on the go, your internet connection can expose your personal data and
location to hackers, advertisers, and other third parties who can use cookies and your IP to track you.</p>
<p>That’s why you need Mozilla VPN, a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use VPN service that keeps your online activity away from
prying eyes.</p>
<h3>What is Mozilla VPN?</h3>
<p>Mozilla VPN is a virtual private network service that encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address.</p>
<p>With Mozilla VPN you can get:</p>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
  <li><strong>Protection for up to 5 devices:</strong>Use Mozilla VPN on your iPad and up to four other devices with one subscription. You can also use it on Windows, Mac,
  Linux, iPhone, and Android.</li>
  <li><strong>Access to servers in 30+ countries:</strong> You can choose from over 500 servers in more than 30 countries worldwide to connect
  to the internet. This gives you more options and flexibility to access the content you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Device-level traffic encryption:</strong> Mozilla VPN encrypts all your traffic before it leaves your device, not just your
  browser’s, but also apps, games, and streaming services. You can also use Mozilla VPN to block ads and trackers that can
  compromise your privacy.</li>
  <li><strong>No online activity logs:</strong> Mozilla doesn't log which websites you visit or inspect your communications.</li>
  <li><strong>Feel safe using public Wi-Fi:</strong> When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, such as at a coffee shop or airport, your data
  might be able to be intercepted by hackers or malicious actors. With Mozilla VPN, your data is encrypted to prevent
  anyone from snooping on your online activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mozilla VPN is backed by Mozilla Foundation, the not-for-profit backing Firefox, one of the most popular and
privacy-focused browsers in the world. By choosing Mozilla VPN, you’re supporting our mission to keep the internet open
and accessible for everyone.</p>
