<p>In today’s mobile-focused world, we rely on our mobile phones and devices for communication, entertainment and work.
However, without a VPN, your personal information may be vulnerable to several security and privacy risks.</p>
<h3>Why do I need a VPN for Mobile?</h3>
<ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
  <li>The Mozilla VPN mobile app is small, so it doesn’t use up too much of your memory, and it won’t slow down your phone or
  burn through your battery.</li>
  <li>Your internet service provider (ISP) may throttle your bandwidth if they know you are watching movies, listening to
  music, or streaming</li>
  <li>Your ISP may block websites or services that they don’t like or which compete with their own</li>
  <li>Hackers can steal your personal data when you are using public wifi, such as in cafes or airports</li>
</ul>
<p>A VPN works across your device, not just your browser, therefore across your mobile apps too. And unlike free VPNs or
proxy sites, which may pay for their servers by spying on you and selling your information, Mozilla does not keep
records of where you go and what you do.
</p>
