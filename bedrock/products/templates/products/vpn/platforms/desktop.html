  <p>VPNs can provide an additional layer of security for your laptop or PC and help protect you from hacking attempts,
  phishing attacks, and other online threats. VPNs encrypt your data and location by creating a “tunnel” between your
  computer and the internet. If your laptop or PC isn’t using a VPN, hackers and third parties might be able to intercept
  your traffic, putting your privacy at risk.</p>
  <h3>How does a VPN protect my laptop or PC?</h3>
  <p>There are several reasons why you should use a VPN to protect yourself when using your laptop or PC:</p>
  <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
    <li><strong>Stronger privacy:</strong> Because a VPN masks your IP address, you can browse the internet more privately, knowing that your
    activity can’t be stitched together by data collectors using your IP as a unique identifier.</li>
    <li><strong>Safer against spying:</strong> Encrypting your data through a VPN makes it virtually impossible for anybody snooping on your
    network connection to know what and with whom you are communicating.</li>
  </ul>
