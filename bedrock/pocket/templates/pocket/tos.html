    <section id="disputes">
      <h2>Disputes</h2>
      <p><strong class="uppercase">Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your use of any of the pocket technologies, including without limitation any disputes related to the pocket premium subscription service, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. the federal arbitration act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</strong></p>
      <p><strong class="uppercase">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. an arbitrator, however, may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, without limitation, injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these terms of service as a court would. arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, and allows for more limited discovery than in court. the arbitrator will decide all issues, including, without limitation, issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.</strong></p>
      <p>To initiate an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: President, Mozilla Corporation/Pocket Business Unit, 2 Harrison Street, Suite 175, San Francisco, CA 94105. Unless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration will take place in the county (or parish) where you live. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with that organization’s "Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures" if JAMS has an office in the county (or parish) where the arbitration takes place. Otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. JAMS rules and other information are available at https://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 800.352.5267. The AAA’s rules and other information are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable JAMS or AAA rules. We will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fees, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the applicable JAMS or AAA rules. The arbitrator shall have the discretion to award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including the cost of the arbitration and of experts) to the prevailing party, but we will only seek such fees if the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
      <p><strong class="uppercase">We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. if for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.</strong></p>

      <h2>Access by Children</h2>
      <p>In the United States, if you are a device manufacturer or other third party (the "Sponsor") that provides devices to children under the age of 13 that utilize the Pocket Technologies, you assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). This means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Pocket application the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Pocket Technologies. Schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.</p>
      <p>Except as provided in the paragraph above, the Pocket Technologies are not for individuals under the age of 13. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to it.</p>
