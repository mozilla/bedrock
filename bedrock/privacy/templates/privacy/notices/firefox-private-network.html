        Enabling this Service keeps your Firefox web browsing activity private from your internet service provider,
        and most websites you visit, by encrypting and routing it through our partner Cloudflare’s network instead.

              <strong>Cloudflare receives your web browsing data to provide the Service:</strong> As you browse,
              Firefox will encrypt the data you send to websites and send it to Cloudflare. Cloudflare will also
              receive your computer’s IP address, the IP address of the site you are browsing to, the timestamp,
              and a unique identifier. Cloudflare does not share this data with others and deletes this after
              24 hours unless necessary for its security or legal obligations. Learn more at
              <a href="{{ cloudflare }}">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy for Firefox Private Network</a>.

              <strong>This Service protects most—but not all—of your web browsing:</strong> The Service only works
              in Firefox and for websites that communicate with your computer using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
              For example, it does not work for data exchanged on certain video conferencing services (such as Google
              Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, GoToMeeting) or on applications outside of Firefox (such as other apps on
              your device). <a href="{{ service }}">Learn more here</a>.
