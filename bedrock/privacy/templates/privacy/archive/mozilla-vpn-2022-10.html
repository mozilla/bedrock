  <h2>Things you should know:</h2>
  <section id="information-we-collect">
    <h3>Information we collect</h3>
    <p><strong>Firefox Account information.</strong> This service requires a Firefox Account, which sends Mozilla VPN your email address, locale, and IP address. Learn more about <a href="{{ url('privacy.notices.firefox') }}#firefox-accounts-join-firefox">Firefox Account data practices</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Location information.</strong> Mozilla VPN receives your IP address from your Firefox Account when you sign up for and use the service. We use the IP address in order to approximate your location because Mozilla VPN is currently only available in certain countries.</p>
    <p><strong>Payment information.</strong> When you subscribe to Mozilla VPN, you will send payment through one of our third-party payment providers: Stripe, Apple, PayPal, or Google Pay. Mozilla receives a record of your account (including your billing address and the last four digits of your payment method) and the status of your account’s subscription. Mozilla does not store your full payment details. </p>
    <p><strong>Campaign and referral data.</strong> This helps Mozilla VPN understand the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. Upon installation of the app, Mozilla may temporarily receive your IP address in addition to campaign data and referral data like what ad campaigns you engaged with and your operating system, device type, and operating system version. Mozilla shares this with Adjust, but we do not share or store your IP address. Read the documentation <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/mozilla-vpn-client/blob/main/src/adjust/adjust.md">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Interaction data.</strong> Mozilla receives data about your interactions with Mozilla VPN, including when you log in and when you request the server list.</p>
    <p><strong>Technical data.</strong> Mozilla receives basic information from Mozilla VPN about the installed VPN version and the devices it’s installed on, including the operating system and hardware configuration. When Mozilla VPN connects to our servers to authenticate and update your Mozilla VPN account, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs. No server logs of your network activity are maintained by our partner Mullvad when you're using the Mozilla VPN service.</p>
    <p>We use the data to improve performance and stability for our users, and to measure Mozilla VPN's performance.</p>
