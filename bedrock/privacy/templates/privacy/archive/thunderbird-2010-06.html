    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Except as described below, Mozilla Messaging does not collect or require visitors to its web sites to furnish personally-identifying information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Like most web site operators, Mozilla Messaging does collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and date and time of each visitor request. Mozilla Messaging also collects potentially-personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally-identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.</p>
    <p>Mozilla Messaging's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how Mozilla Messaging's visitors use its web sites. To that end, Mozilla Messaging may share potentially-personally-identifying information with its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations. Mozilla Messaging may also release non-personally-identifying information about visitors (e.g., by publishing a report on web site usage trends). Otherwise, Mozilla Messaging will not publicly release potentially-personally-identifying information except under the same circumstances as Mozilla Messaging releases personally-identifying information. Those circumstances are explained below.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Community Members</h2>
    <p>Certain members of the Mozilla Messaging community (contributors, customers, etc.) choose to interact with Mozilla Messaging in ways that require Mozilla Messaging and others to know more about them. The amount and type of information that Mozilla Messaging gathers from those members depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, members who wish to post content to certain portions of Mozilla Messaging's web sites or participate in live chat session(s) are asked to provide usernames that identify that content as having been posted by a particular member. Developers, by comparison, are asked to provide contact information, up to and sometimes including telephone or fax numbers, so that they can be contacted as necessary. In each case, Mozilla Messaging collects personally-identifying information only insofar as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the community member's interaction with Mozilla Messaging.</p>
    <p>Mozilla Messaging is an open organization that believes in sharing as much information as possible about its products, its operations and its associations. Accordingly, community members should assume - as should most folks who interact with Mozilla Messaging - that any personally-identifying information provided to Mozilla Messaging will be made available to the public. There are three broad exceptions to that rule:</p>
    <ol class="mzp-u-list-styled">
      <li>Mozilla Messaging does not publicly release information gathered in connection with commercial transactions (i.e., transactions involving money).</li>
      <li>Mozilla Messaging does not make publicly available information that is used to authenticate users the publication of which would compromise the security of Mozilla Messaging's web sites (e.g., passwords).</li>
      <li>Mozilla Messaging does not make publicly available information that it specifically promises at the time of collection to maintain in confidence.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Outside those three contexts, users should assume that personally-identifying information provided through Mozilla Messaging's web sites will be made available to the public.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Interactive Product Features</h2>
    <p>Certain Mozilla Messaging products contain features that report, or that permit users to report, the user's usage patterns and problems - whether caused by Mozilla Messaging's software, third-party software, or third-party web sites - to Mozilla Messaging. The reports generated by these features typically include non-personally-identifying information such as the configuration of the user's computer and the code running at the time the problem occurred. Some of these features give users the option of providing personally-identifying information, though none of these features require it. Some Mozilla Messaging software features that do permit users to provide personally-identifying information advise, in advance, that such information will not be made publicly available. Mozilla Messaging analyzes the information provided by these interactive product features to develop a better understanding of how its products are performing and being used. It does not use the information to track the usage of its products by identifiable individuals.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Where Mozilla Messaging has collected personally-identifying information subject to one of the three exceptions described in the Community Members section, above, it discloses that information only to those of its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on Mozilla Messaging's behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to others.  Some of those employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mozilla Messaging's web sites, you consent to the transfer of your information to them. Mozilla Messaging does not rent or sell such information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations, as described above, Mozilla Messaging discloses such information only when required to do so by law, or when Mozilla Messaging believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mozilla Messaging, members of the Mozilla Messaging community, or the public at large. Mozilla Messaging takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of such information.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Updating of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Mozilla Messaging permits users to freely update and correct their personally-identifying information as maintained by Mozilla Messaging. To do so, users should look for links or contact information available on whichever Mozilla Messaging web sites store the relevant information (e.g., Bugzilla users should go to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=account">Account Settings</a>) or contact Mozilla Messaging by using one of the email addresses listed below.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Clear GIFs</h2>
    <p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a web site stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the web site each time the visitor returns. Most major web sites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the web site at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a web site to "recognize" a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in Mozilla cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with Mozilla Messaging and, where applicable, its third-party service provider.</p>
    <p><strong>What Are Clear GIFs?</strong> Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help web site operators understand how visitors interact with their web sites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. It makes it easer to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a web site.</p>
    <p><strong>How We Use Cookies and Clear GIFs.</strong> Mozilla Messaging's web sites use cookies to help Mozilla Messaging identify and track visitors, their usage of Mozilla Messaging web sites, and their web site access preferences across multiple requests and visits to Mozilla Messaging's web sites. The Mozilla Messaging.com web sites, and advertisements that Mozilla Messaging may run occasionally on third‑party advertising networks, also may use clear gifs for these purposes. The basic idea is to gather aggregate data about how people use the Mozilla Messaging web sites. The term usually used to describe this is "web analytics" and the cookies and clear gifs are the tools by which a website owner collects this web analytics data.</p>
    <p>Mozilla Messaging will use the web analytics data only to determine aggregate usage patterns for our web sites as described above. Mozilla Messaging web sites do this by using either its own internal analytics software or by sending this information to a third-party service provider to help Mozilla Messaging analyze this data and the Mozilla Messaging web sites using third-party web analytics tools are listed <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/third-party.html">here</a>. Mozilla Messaging has agreements with its third-party service providers that they will not share this information with others or use the information for purposes other than to maintain the services they provide to Mozilla Messaging. It is possible to link cookies and clear gifs to personally-identifying information, thereby permitting web site operators, including our third-party analytics providers, to track the online movements of particular individuals. Mozilla Messaging does not do so and its third-party service providers are not allowed to correlate Mozilla Messaging data with any other data.</p>
    <p>Mozilla Messaging uses the information provided by cookies and clear gifs to develop a better understanding of how Mozilla Messaging's visitors use Mozilla Messaging's web sites, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with Mozilla Messaging's web sites. Mozilla Messaging may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally-identifying information or potentially-personally-identifying information.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Control the Use of Cookies.</strong> You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Mozilla Messaging visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by Mozilla Messaging, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to Mozilla Messaging's web sites. Certain features of Mozilla Messaging's web sites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

Substantive changes will also be announced through the standard mechanisms through which Mozilla Messaging communicates with the Mozilla Messaging community, including Mozilla Messaging's “announce” <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/announce">mailing list</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.announce">newsgroup</a>.</p>
