      (that's us) our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we use that

          When you make calls, the data below is sent to Mozilla in order to
          connect the call. Once connected, your communications are encrypted.
        </p>

          <li>

              <strong>Firefox Accounts</strong>: Accounts are optional to use
              with Firefox Hello. If you sign-in with a Firefox Account, your
              Firefox browser sends Mozilla your account name in order to
              direct calls to you. To learn more about how data is used by
              Firefox Accounts, click
              <a href="{{ url('privacy.notices.firefox') }}">here</a>.

              <strong>Contact Information</strong>: You can import or add new
              contacts to create an address book with email addresses, profile
              pictures, and names of people you may call. This contact
              information is stored locally on your device. When you use the
              Service, your Firefox browser encrypts your contact's
              information and sends it to us to connect calls.  If your call
              is through a conversation URL that you generate, we delete the
              contact information after 30 days but you can delete it sooner
              by revoking the conversation URL. Otherwise, for direct calls,
              we delete this information once the call is finished.

            <p>
              <strong>Feedback &amp; Support</strong>: Sending feedback to
              Mozilla is optional. You can provide us with information if you
              submit a crash report or a report on our support forum.

              <strong>Performance metrics</strong>: We automatically receive

              calls in order to detect issues, diagnose them, and improve
              Firefox Hello. For example, the data we receive includes quality
              for audio and video streams, whether calls failed or were
              disconnected, duration of the call, obfuscated IP addresses,
              obfuscated network and hardware data (e.g. if you are on a wifi
              or cellular network) and timestamps.

              <strong>Analytics</strong>: If you use the web-based Hello
              client to join a conversation by following a link to
              https://hello.firefox.com, we may also use cookies and third
              party services to help us understand in the aggregate how users
              engage with Hello. We use:

              <li>
                <p>
                  Google Analytics, which places a cookie on your device, to
                  obtain metrics on how users engage with Hello. This helps us
                  to improve the Hello service.

                  Optimizely, which places a cookie on your device, to help us
                  test variations of Hello. This helps us offer better
                  experiences to Hello users.

              <strong>Tiles</strong>: Tiles are a feature of Hello which may
              be displayed during a conversation or while a user is waiting
              for a conversation to begin. In order to provide the tiles
              feature, Hello sends to Mozilla data relating to the tiles such
              as number of clicks, impressions, your IP address, and locale
              information.

              <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google
              Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>. The add-on keeps your
