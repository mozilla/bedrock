  <h2>At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.</h2>
  <p>
    That’s why we build Firefox Reality, and all our products, to give you greater control over the
    information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what
    we need to improve Firefox Reality for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox Reality shares and point you to settings to
    share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla
    <a href="{{ url('privacy') }}">privacy policy</a> for how we receive, handle and share information we collect
    from Firefox Reality.
