      <div itemprop="description">
        <p>At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.</p>
        <p>That’s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve our products for everyone and work with partners who share a commitment to protecting our users. One of our technology partners is Cliqz GmbH, a German company owned by Hubert Burda Media and Mozilla, the maker of Firefox. Cliqz shows results and websites recommendations directly in the Firefox URL bar. If you are using a version of Firefox with Cliqz search recommendations, Cliqz will receive data in order to carry out your requests, as well as anonymized browsing data used to create the search engine index. Cliqz does not build browsing profiles for identifiable individual users with this data and, like Firefox, Cliqz is <a href="https://github.com/cliqz-oss">open source</a>. This means that the software can be viewed and examined by the public. You can read more about this data <a href="#cliqz-features">below</a>, including how to disable data sharing and search recommendations.</p>
        <p>In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla privacy policy for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Webpage and technical data to Google’s SafeBrowsing service</strong>: To help protect you from malicious downloads, Firefox sends basic information about unrecognized downloads to Google's SafeBrowsing Service, including the filename and the URL it was downloaded from. </p>

Opting out prevents Firefox from warning you of potentially illegitimate or malicious websites or downloaded files.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities</strong>: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with "HTTPS"), Firefox validates the website's <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/secure-website-certificate">certificate</a>. This may involve Firefox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website. </p>
