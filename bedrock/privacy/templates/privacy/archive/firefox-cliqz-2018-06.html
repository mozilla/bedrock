      <time datetime="2017-09-28" itemprop="dateModified">Archived, June 26, 2018</time>
      <div itemprop="description">
        <p>At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.</p>
        <p>That’s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve our products for everyone and work with partners who share a commitment to protecting our users. One of our technology partners is Cliqz GmbH, a German company owned by Hubert Burda Media and Mozilla, the maker of Firefox. Cliqz shows results and websites recommendations directly in the Firefox URL bar. If you are using a version of Firefox with Cliqz search recommendations, Cliqz will receive data in order to carry out your requests, as well as anonymized browsing data used to create the search engine index. Cliqz does not build browsing profiles for identifiable individual users with this data and, like Firefox, Cliqz is <a href="https://github.com/cliqz-oss">open source</a>. This means that the software can be viewed and examined by the public. You can read more about this data <a href="#cliqz-features">below</a>, including how to disable data sharing and search recommendations.</p>
        <p>In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla <a href="{{ url('privacy') }}">privacy policy</a> for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox.</p>

            <h3>Use Cliqz Results</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Firefox with Cliqz by default connects to Cliqz to display search results in the URL bar. Cliqz GmbH is a German company offering a privacy oriented search experience.  Learn more at their <a href="https://cliqz.com/en/privacy-browser">privacy policy</a>.  When the Cliqz feature is enabled:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Search Queries and Webpage Data to Cliqz</strong>: The users of Firefox with Cliqz contribute anonymized data that Cliqz uses to improve the recommendation rankings via Cliqz’s Human Web technology. This data includes text typed in the URL bar, queries sent to certain search engines, and data about the visited webpages and interactions with those pages, such as mouse movements, scrolls, and time spent. To protect your privacy, Cliqz removes sensitive information including any kind of user identifiers or potential user identifers (UIDs) from this browsing data before it is ever sent from Firefox.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Interaction Data to Cliqz</strong>: This includes your interactions with specific fields and buttons in the Cliqz feature. This data is tied to a unique identifier allowing Cliqz to understand performance over time. The data is not associated with your search queries or webpage data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Interaction Data to Mozilla</strong>: This includes counts of visits to search engine pages, which search engines you use, and your Cliqz identifier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Location Data to Cliqz</strong>: This includes your location whenever you open a new window or type in the URL bar. Cliqz uses this data to provide context for search recommendations (e.g. searches for nearby stores), but does not retain a copy of this location. You may opt-out of location sharing in the Cliqz Settings menu in the URL bar, but this may decrease the quality of your search recommendations. </p>

          </ul>
          <p><a href="https://cliqz.com/en/whycliqz/transparency">Learn more</a> about Cliqz data collection. To check if the Cliqz feature is enabled or to disable data collection:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Type "about:addons" into your Firefox URL bar</li>
            <li>Select "Extensions" on the left menu bar</li>

              <p id="auto-updates"><strong>Technical data for updates</strong>: Desktop versions of Firefox periodically check for browser updates by connecting to Mozilla servers. Your Firefox version, language, and device operating system are used to apply the correct updates. Mobile versions of Firefox may connect to another service if you used one to download and install Firefox. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-stop-firefox-automatically-making-connections#w_auto-update-checking">Learn more</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>Technical data for add-ons blocklist</strong>: Firefox for Desktop and Android periodically connect to Mozilla to protect you and others from malicious add-ons.  Your Firefox version and language, device operating system, and list of installed add-ons are needed to apply and update the add-ons blocklist. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connections">Learn more</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Webpage and technical data to Google’s SafeBrowsing service</strong>: To help protect you from malicious downloads, Firefox sends basic information about unrecognized downloads to Google's SafeBrowsing Service, including the filename and the URL it was downloaded from.</p>

Opting out prevents Firefox from warning you of potentially illegitimate or malicious websites or downloaded files.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities</strong>: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with "HTTPS"), Firefox validates the website's <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/secure-website-certificate">certificate</a>. This may involve Firefox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website.</p>
              <p>Opting out increases the risk of your private information being intercepted. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/advanced-settings-browsing-network-updates-encryption#w_certificates-tab">Learn more</a>.</p>
