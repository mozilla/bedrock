    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Firefox Monitor is a service provided by Mozilla to promote online safety. We strongly encourage people
      not to reuse passwords because—if any of those accounts are compromised—then hackers can access other
      accounts using the same account credentials. Because account credentials are often reused when
      registering for services, we think it’s important to know which accounts have been compromised in a
      publicly disclosed data breach.

    <h2>2. Features</h2>
    <p>
      Using your email address, you can do a Basic Scan on our website or sign up to receive a Full Report,
      Breach Alerts, and Safety Tips.<br> <em>Basic Scan:</em> <em>These results display most publicly known
      breaches. They exclude “Sensitive Breaches” (those including minors’ data or participants of adult and
      dating sites) in order to protect the privacy of those account holders</em>.<br> <strong>Full Report:
      </strong> This includes a complete list of publicly known hacks, including Sensitive Breaches.
      * <strong>Breach Alerts:</strong> This notifies you if your email address appears in a new data breach.
      * <strong>Safety Tips:</strong> This sends you occasional online safety tips from Mozilla.

    <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      If you become aware that your account credentials have been compromised, you should immediately update
      your passwords and any other credentials for those accounts, as well as other services using the same or
      similar account information. It is your responsibility to protect your online accounts using strong and
      different passwords, security questions, two-factor authentication, password managers, and other safety
      measures.
