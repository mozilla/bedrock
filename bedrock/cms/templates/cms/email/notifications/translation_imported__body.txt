Hi there

ACTION REQUIRED: A new translation has been synced back from Smartling
and needs to be published.

It is Job '{{job_name}}' for '{{translation_source_name}}' into {{translation_target_language_code}}.

You can view the job at {{smartling_cms_dashboard_url}}

From there, for each item listed under "Translations", please open it in a new tab, review and publish it.

Please note that you may need to publish things in a particular order (e.g. Snippet before the Page that uses it.)

Many thanks

P.S. If you find this process painful, please come and tell us about it in #www!
