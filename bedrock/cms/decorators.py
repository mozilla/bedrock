    """
    A decorator that helps us migrate from pure Django-based views
    to CMS views, or support having _some_ locales served from the CMS and
    other / evergreen content in other locales coming from Django views .

    It will try to see if `wagtail.views.serve` can find a live CMS page for the
    URL path that matches the current Django view's path, and if so, will
    return that. If not, it will let the regular Django view run.

    Args:
        view_func - the function to wrap
        fallback_ftl_files (optional) - a list of the names of the Fluent files used by
            the Django view that's being wrapped. It's a little repetitive, but
            from those we can work out what locales the page is availble in
            across the CMS and Django views
        fallback_lang_codes (optional) - a list of strings of language codes that
            show what locales are available for the Django view being wrapped.
            This is useful if, for some reason, the Fluent files are not a reliable
            way to determine the available locales for a page
            (e.g. the Fluent files cover 20 locales for some strings which appear
            on the page, but the main localized content is only in two languages,
            because the contnet doesn't come from Fluent - such as Legal Docs,
            which comes from a git repo). This works best when all the pages
            for the decorated route are available in all the specified locales --
            if not, some of the footer language-selector options will 404.
        fallback_callable (optional) - a method or function that takes the same
            arguments as the URL path (if any) in order to return a list of appropriate
            locale language codes. This is intended for use if we can't reliably
            pass either fluent files or specific lang codes (e.g. the view being
            decorated is not consistently translated via whatever non-Fluent method
            is being used)

        Note that setting both fallback_lang_codes and fallback_ftl_files will cause
        an exception to be raised - only one should be set, not both.

    Workflow:

    1. This decorator is added to the target view that will be replaced with CMS content
    2. Code is deployed and initially serves the original Django page
    3. CMS content is added for /path/to/page/ -- and can be previewed and approved
       without affecting the existing Django page at all
    4. CMS Page is published and starts getting served as it is "preferred" over the Django page
    5. Later, in a second changeset, the Django view and relevant URLconf item can be removed

    Example for a function-based view:

        @prefer_cms(fallback_ftl_files=[...])  # or fallback_lang_codes or fallback_callable
        def some_path(request):
            ...

    Or, in a URLconf for a regular Django view:

        ...
        path("some/path/", prefer_cms(views.some_view, fallback_ftl_files=[...])),

        # or

        path("some/path/", prefer_cms(views.some_view, fallback_lang_codes=["fr", "pt-BR",])),

        ...

        # or

        path("some/path/", prefer_cms(views.some_view, fallback_callable=path.to.callable)),

        ...

    IMPORTANT: there's no support for bedrock.mozorg.util.page(), deliberately.

        Making prefer_cms work with our page() helper would have made that function
        more complex. Given that it's straightforward to convert a page()-based view to
        a dedicated TemplateView, which _can_ be decorated with prefer_cms at the
        URLConf level, that is the recommended approach if you are migrating a page()
        based view to the CMS, or need to have hybrid behaviour.
