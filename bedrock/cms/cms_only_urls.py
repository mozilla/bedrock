# This module contains named URL paths which only exist in the CMS.
#
# They are named so that they can be looked up via our url() jinja
# helper, even though the actual page exists in the CMS only.
#
# These URLs will/must have matching routes set up in the CMS pages
# else they will lead to a 404 from the CMS.
#
# Note that all URL routes defined here should point to the
# dummy_view function, which never gets called because this
# urlconf is only use with reverse(), never resolve()
