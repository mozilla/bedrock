# This module contains named URL paths which only exist in the CMS.
#
# They are named so that they can be looked up via our url() jinja
# helper, even though the actual page exists in the CMS only.
#
# These URLs must have matching routes set up in the CMS pages
# else they can lead to a 404 from the CMS. If the CMS has a translated
# version of that page available in a locale that the user prefers
# (via their Accept-Language header) or in the default
# settings.LANGUAGE_CODE locale, the user will be redirected to that.
#
# Note that all URL routes defined here should point to the
# dummy_view function, which never gets called because this
# urlconf is only use with reverse(), never resolve()
