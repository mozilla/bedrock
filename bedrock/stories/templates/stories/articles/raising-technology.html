<p>Pamela Pavliscak is a tech emotionographer, documenting the interplay between technology and our emotions. Her work brings together creative research, affective computing, and expressive interfaces to make heartfelt and humankind technology. The author of Emotionally Intelligent Design, she teaches at the Pratt Institute and is a frequent speaker on topics from the era of big emotion, the ethics of care, and emojis. Mozilla recently spoke with Pavliscak about designing emotionally aware technology. Here’s a condensed, edited version of her remarks.</p>
<p>“Watching my kids trying to negotiate technology as they define who they are and who they want to be first got me thinking about its emotional side. In popular culture, the focus is on how technology makes us feel terrible, ashamed, envious or outraged. The solution is that we’re supposed to stay away from technology more. But, of course, we can’t.</p>
<p>Inside the industry, our focus is very much on making technology simple, straightforward and frictionless. If it does things well, maybe then we can think about giving people an extra thrill or delight. That helps us avoid people becoming annoyed or frustrated, but I think leaves out our true experience of technology, which isn’t calm or free of emotion. It is interwoven with how we're feeling that day about ourselves, about who we are with, and about what we just did. That doesn't fit into the perfect journeys and perfect personas the industry uses.</p>
<p>I say emotionally intelligent design instead of emotional design, because we tend to think of the latter as manipulating people. For me, the concept of emotional intelligence – where we become more aware of our emotions and more sympathetic to other people's emotions – is what I really want for design. Emotionally intelligent design doesn't necessarily have to create an emotion in you. It needs to understand how people are feeling and have some sensitivity and awareness about it.</p>
<p>That means doing more thinking up front about trying to understand what people are feeling and how a certain product fits with that. If you want people to be joyful about accomplishing something, then you can design toward that goal. You can look at the research in sociology and psychology about what creates and sustains joy, and then you ask questions about how people experience it. As with any design process, you test and evaluate ideas and have to look at them in context, because we tend to make general rules. You see guides saying this color means this or that, but I think those are incredibly simplistic. Color interacts with texture, scent, personality – and even those are very dependent on context.</p>
<p>Technology that tries to detect emotion is very controversial and rightly so, because it's extremely limited now. It's taking all this complexity and saying, for example, that there are about 20 different kinds of smiles. There are flawed ideas that emotion can be mapped directly to physical expression or tone of voice.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's a right metric or measure or target for emotion, because nobody wants a dystopia where we have to smile to pay for something or fake our feelings to interact with a machine. We have to throw away the idea of accuracy and numbers and think in a more holistic way.<p>
<p>Ideally, you would have technology that has sensitivity to the fact that you aren’t always happy on Tuesdays or you're not always angry at 4 o'clock, and can pick up on patterns. Maybe you have little kids and you’re tired around 5 o’clock every day, and technology gives you more awareness of that and you have a snack at 4:30 p.m. and feel a little better.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any perfect examples of where this is working now, but many industries have the potential to do good things and not just say they know best and here’s what people should do. In health care and mental health, companies are trying to find the line between making something helpful without being overbearing. Gaming is another area to watch because it's so tapped into emotion.</p>
<p>As we experience technology, we really have to think about more than the practical side.  I think it's fair to expect something beyond that. Ask yourself questions: Does it make me feel terrible about myself? Is it undermining a relationship or making me feel wound up when I want to unwind? How is it impacting my emotional life and my experience of the world around me? I think we should expect more from our technology.”</p>
