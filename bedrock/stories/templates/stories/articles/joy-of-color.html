    <p>As she began hunting for what brings people joy, Ingrid Fetell Lee quickly discovered the power of color. It starts in our DNA. Spotting ripe fruits and tender greens among the trees once was an evolutionary advantage, though it took a series of genetic mutations spanning tens of millions of years before bichromatic humans developed color vision and the shadowy grays around them transformed into rainbow hues.</p>
    <p> “Of course, we don't look at a brightly colored wall now and think ‘I'm going to eat that,’ but because of how our brains evolved there’s a primal feeling of energy that we get from seeing bright color,” said Lee, a designer, author and founder of <a href="https://aestheticsofjoy.com/">the Aesthetics of Joy</a>.</p>
    <p>Color is vitality, nourishment, a joy-boosting power source, but the digital environments where people spend more and more of their lives are energy-zapping gray. Despite the myriad advances since the personal computer was invented decades ago, technology’s bias toward dull color remains. To be sure, practical and functional considerations drive some of those choices. But the internet has evolved from a place to perform a specific task to a thriving, creative, essential world that touches most aspects of our lives. Isn’t it time for a more colorful web that can, as Marie Kondo put it, spark joy?</p>
    <p>With Colorways, Firefox has answered a resounding yes. The limited-time color drops allow people to customize their browsers by choosing from seasonal shades, and change them as often as they like. “Privacy has been part of Mozilla’s vision from day one, and now we’re making the connection that a safe and joyful internet is a colorful one,” said Mikal Lewis, senior director, of product management for Firefox. “We know that we are spending more time in this digital ecosystem — not the concrete jungle, but the digital jungle. So much more of our life is flowing through what have historically been these gray boxes. And we don’t really tolerate this type of what I would say are one-size-fits-all tools anywhere else in our lives.”</p>

    <p>Behind “Independent Voices,” the new Colorways drop, is streetwear and sneaker designer Keely Alexis. In her first collaboration with a tech company, Alexis – best known for the Air Jordans and other sneakers she created at Nike, created bold and vibrant Colorways based on values she shares with Mozilla. “Independent Voices are the voices of the past and present that create a better future,” she said. “I chose this as my inspiration for the collaboration because it not only feels authentic to me but aligns with Firefox and the vision that we can make the world better, on the internet and beyond.”</p>

    <h3 class="c-stories-article-section-title">Why the Web Is Grey</h3>
    <p>Our innate love of color is a big reason, a bit paradoxically, for its limited use in the digital environment. As technology developed, it took its cues from a culture in the thrall of efficiency and defined by a minimalist, conformist aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Digital design’s somber tones have a parallel in architecture. The modernist movement of the early 20th century turned sharply away from decorative touches, including color. Lee referred to “Ornament and Crime,” a lecture and essay in which architect Adolph Loos decried the use of decoration in useful objects, as influential in the shift toward bland, boxy buildings. The prevailing view was that only those who lacked restraint -- children and people in non-Western societies –- favored bright colors.</p>
    <p>“Holding back from color was a sign of spiritual strength, so by engaging decoration or an abundance of color you were basically giving in to a moral weakness,” said Lee. “I think there's a real kind of colonialist perspective here, with Western Europeans attempting to draw a boundary and distance between themselves and people that they were colonizing.”</p>
    <p>Despite that classist and overwrought argument, the notion that sophisticated people stay away from color seeped into American culture. Color might be acceptable in art, but neutral colors and minimalism became the status quo among those who considered themselves arbiters of taste. Home design embraced a narrow, neutral palette. Black clothing signaled authority, refinement and seriousness: Witness the head-to-toe black outfits of Manhattanites and Steve Jobs’ turtlenecks.</p>
    <p>The rise of the subdued aesthetic neatly dovetailed with society’s growing obsession with productivity. In the drive for maximum efficiency, workplaces from factories to call centers to offices were designed to limit distractions. Workers were viewed not as individuals, but cogs in a machine that companies could endlessly fine-tune.</p>
    <p>“A lot of us have been made to feel that being drawn to color makes us somehow self-indulgent or immature, and so we tell ourselves that we like something else and we try to grow up in our aesthetic,” said Lee. “I think that to some extent consumer technology has that mindset as well.”</p>

    <h3 class="c-stories-article-section-title">Beyond Function to Feeling</h3>
    <p>Beyond the cultural narrative, technology’s palette is primarily the result of functional choices. “Nature does a really good job with color –- it’s harmonious and nuanced,” said Amber Case, a cyborg anthropologist and UX designer. “But in the human world, we have a lot of supernormal stimuli so we design first without color, then we can add color to it.”</p>
    <p>Once functionality is achieved, the addition of color becomes deliberate. Designers add color to direct people’s attention and prompt action. “The people who are best at using color online are obviously advertisers,” said Case. “They know exactly what color to use to bypass the ego and frontal cortex to get people to take action.”</p>
    <p>Those bright “buy now” buttons and banner ads succeed because of the deep connection between color and human emotion. That link, however, also undermines some of the theories that led to dull-colored work environments. Stripping an environment of distractions to enhance productivity is, at best, partially true. There are some good reasons to limit distractions in digital spaces. Subdued colors on a website or platform can help backgrounds retreat, keeping the focus on content. The pinging and popping of notifications can also negatively impact concentration.</p>
    <p>Some distractions, however, boost our mood and productivity. At the top of the list: color and light. Colorful artwork on walls and windows that reveal a glimpse of sky or trees can reenergize people throughout the day. “You can't sit for eight hours a day and stare at the laptop,” said Lee. “We know that people perform better, and are actually more productive and more efficient when they have distractions that are beneficial.”</p>
    <p>Research from several countries, said Lee, concluded that people in more colorful work environments are more alert, confident, friendly, and joyful than people working in drab spaces. “Those studies were conducted in physical environments,” she said, “but I have to think our response to it is so deep and so hardwired that I would imagine it would apply in the digital realm.”</p>
    <p>Firefox’s research confirmed that to be the case. “We identified that color is a way to connect with people across all divides –- it is a universal language that transcends the boundaries of our diverse verbal languages,” said Lewis. Early tests of the concept were resoundingly positive, and Firefox decided to include the option in future releases – and to change the typical language associated with technology’s look and feel.</p>
    <p>“We chose to call it Colorways rather than themes to show we are branching out from our ‘language of browser’ to speak the language of everyday life and everyday users,” said Lewis. “It feels like a natural extension to allow people to make this tool that they’re leveraging every day feel more of their own, to feel fresh, to be exciting, to just bring in that small moment of delight to their day.”</p>

    <h3 class="c-stories-article-section-title">Building a More Inclusive Web</h3>
    <p>The appreciation of color may be a human universal, but preferences –- even perceptions –- are highly variable. They can also change with time, moods and circumstances. When researching a book about sound and design, Case found that people tend to enjoy switching up colors every few months. They grow tired of a shade, or like to align their choice with the changing seasons. In traditional Japanese homes, Case noted, people alter the color scheme in one part of a room as the colors outdoors shift through the seasons. “You may have a home where design is very minimal, but there is a seasonal palette as well,” said Case. “Not everyone would want a Christmas-colored website obviously, but it’s as low-risk as painting your nails to have a seasonal color palette.”</p>
    <p>Lee also has found that many people have lost touch with how particular colors affect them personally at different times: “We all have this intuition for what feels good to us, either in our surroundings or in our technology, and because we've been conditioned to accept gray bland interiors and gray bland tech we've sort of lost touch with that intuition.”</p>
    <p>In that context, the option to customize a browser with color, as Colorways allows, is not just play. “I think it's also a way of starting to reconnect with our intuition around what feels good,” said Lee. “We were living cutoff from it because we live these productivity-driven lives.”</p>
    <p>Case said giving people more choices in designing their digital lives also is a welcome form of inclusivity. “It’s not the colors themselves that are inclusive, it’s that giving a choice is inclusive rather than people being handed something in the one-size-fits all environment that we have now,” she said. “The opportunity to allow people to play with color is the kind of thinking that is bringing humanity and joy back to the internet.”</p>
