          One team
        </h2>

        <p>Though Mozillians sit on functional teams, we are all about working
          as “one team”, reflecting our belief that being highly collaborative
          with a focus on experimentation is essential to individual growth and
          moving Mozilla’s future forward.</p>

        <p>Each one of us has made a choice to spend our time, our energy and
          our gifts, to make the internet a rich, exciting, decent and humane
          place. Meet a few of our teams who are making it happen.</p>

            Our engineers (and we have a lot of them!) work on the most interesting
            challenges facing the internet today — privacy, security, decentralization,
            access, convenience, compatibility and more — collaborating with peers
            not only at Mozilla but across the industry. From Firefox to Pocket,
            Relay to Mozilla VPN, our code touches the lives of millions.

            How can businesses use mountains of data to guide decisions while
            respecting the privacy and security of users? Mozilla’s Data Organization
            is at the forefront of these conversations, with a deep knowledge of
            data processing infrastructure, the market we compete in and our business.
            They work closely with multiple functional areas to keep Mozilla a
            data-informed business that is modern, global and ethical.

            With an experimental mindset at its core, our innovation teams are

            differentiators for our innovation work are the focus on increasing
            inclusion with products such as Hubs which enables broader access to
            immersive web collaboration. Additionally we differentiate with our
            ecosystem engagements such as grant programs, investments and partnerships
            to identify, drive or enable products and businesses aiming to improve
            the human experience on the internet.
