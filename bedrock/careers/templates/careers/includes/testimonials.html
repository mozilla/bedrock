              I really enjoy how everyone on the team comes from different backgrounds (architecture, banking, engineering, etc) and that it's actually really hard to find someone with the same background. Equally as great is knowing that despite a diverse set of backgrounds we share a similar passion and need for data and browser transparency.

              It’s hard to come out. First you have to figure out your own stuff. And at some point along the way you have to consider how revealing your authentic self might affect your experience at work or your career trajectory.

              My journey to understanding my deeply felt gender identity took many decades. By the time I decided to transition my gender presentation to female, I had already worked at Mozilla for a few years. In that time, I saw a workplace culture where people respected differences and appreciated that diverse ideas from a diverse team leads to better work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My transition at work was remarkable for how unremarkable it was. I received congratulations, high-fives and hugs from colleagues. Mozilla’s leadership provided invaluable assistance in this process and our health benefits continue to support gender affirming care.  Now, five years after I came out at work, I’m thriving at Mozilla. I feel respected and appreciated for what I have to offer as my true self.

              I had one of the best onboarding experiences with Mozilla. Be it team introductions, orientation sessions or your 1:1 with your manager, I could clearly sense the culture of openness and inclusion.

              I was hired while on the fifth month of my pregnancy, so needless to say I was worried if that would affect the perception of me as a professional within the team. But my experience with Mozilla has been only empowering and uplifting. Being a new mom, I also cannot describe how much I appreciate the flexibility and benefits provided.

              This year my 20th wedding anniversary also coincided with my wife's work sabbatical, and we decided to take a month long road trip to Yellowstone National Park where we spent our honeymoon. I was able to work from the road at the same time, so we could spend our free time exploring the area and enjoying the time to reflect.

              I have worked a long time in technology companies and can honestly say that no other place that I've worked would have not only been ok with me doing that but also encouraged it as part of good mental health and well being. Mozilla is a special place that truly cares about the people who work here.
