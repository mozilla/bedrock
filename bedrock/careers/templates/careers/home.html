      <h2>Feel good about your work</h2>
      <p>
        Mozilla has big ambitions for the next decade to build impactful products that are <em>different</em> — that have more respect for the individuals using them, that operate with a different business model, and that explore new forms of openness. It’s going to take hard work that Mozilla is uniquely suited to take on. It’s why we’re here. It’s who we are. And it’s our future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bring your drive, your creativity, your big ideas and your new perspectives to make the difference we’re aiming for.

          Our values bring us together as one team
        </h2>
        <p>
          How we work together is as important as what we make together. In 2022, we finalized a yearlong effort to codify what helps our team be its best, and we love where we landed. Our shared operating values drive confident decision-making, boost healthy collaborations and just plain make it easier to get stuff done.

      ) %}
        <p>
          Because we want Mozilla to be a place where everyone can do their best work, and because we know diverse perspectives and experiences result in better solutions, we welcome differences.

        <p>
          We take the long view of our connections and interactions, both with each other and with the people who use our products. This requires a commitment to empathy, active listening and giving without the expectation of getting. It’s digging in to understand what makes people tick and caring about that.

      ) %}
        <p>
          Transparent and open processes are a unique part of our genetic code. When coupled with responsible participation — being generous and kind with both our inputs and our outputs — we create trust and accountability and elevate the quality of our decisions.

        <p>
          We are here to do hard things, take on giants and make a difference in people’s online lives — so we must have grit. Having grit means facing obstacles with optimism, determination to find new ways forward and being relentless about learning from what worked and what didn’t.

          Benefits for real life
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our benefits package is world class. To us, offering a comprehensive, industry-leading health and wellbeing program to our employees and their families is plain common sense, and the right thing to do. We also believe it’s easier to focus on our work when we’re feeling well.

          Mozilla covers medical, dental and vision plan premiums at 100%. Our offerings give you the options you need to manage your health — and your family’s — the way you want.

        <p>
          Mental health is as important as our physical health. That’s why Mozilla’s health benefits include therapy and coaching sessions to make sure our people have access to the care they need.

        <p>
          Time away from work to disconnect and recharge is essential. In addition to country-specific holidays (12 in the U.S.), employees start accruing vacation and sick leave on day one (specifics vary by country). Plus, everyone enjoys quarterly all-company wellness days and the most personal holiday of all: your birthday.

          While Mozilla’s parental leave policies vary globally, our U.S.-based employees can look forward to 26 weeks of paid leave for childbearing parents and 12 weeks of paid leave for non-childbearing parents.
