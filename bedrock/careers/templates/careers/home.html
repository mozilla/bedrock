        At Mozilla, we have big ambitions for the future, we want to build
        impactful products that are different — that are built with more
        respect for the people using them and help us explore new forms
        of openness. It’s going to take hard work that Mozilla is uniquely
        suited to take on. It’s why we’re here. It’s who we are. And it’s our future.

        perspectives to make the difference we’re aiming for.
