        </h2>

        <p>We’ve been a remote-friendly company since our founding in 2005, which
          means we have plenty of experience cultivating a community that balances
          human connection and asynchronous communication. Today, we’re continuing
          to re-imagine the where and how of the way we work.</p>

          Gathering spaces
        </h2>

        <p>As we re-imagine what our offices and coworking spaces can be, we’re proud to have these
          locations for Mozillians to gather around the world. Teams can meet in
          our offices for collaborative and cultural activities that most benefit
          from being face-to-face — for planning, product design sprints,
          hackathons and more. </p>
        <p>We have offices or coworking spaces in a number of locales, including San Francisco, San Mateo, Berlin, Toronto, New York City, Paris, London and Tulsa.</p>
