          What we offer
        </h2>

        <p>Our benefits package is world class. By offering a comprehensive,
          industry-leading health and wellbeing program to our employees and their
          families, we believe it’s easier for everyone to focus on the work we’re
          here to do together. Here’s a sample of what’s included in our benefits
          package. One thing to note: Global benefits vary by location, and a
          recruiter can answer specific questions about your locale.</p>

            assessments and more — so they can select the care that works for
            them in the areas they’d like to focus on.

            With all of life’s demands, time away from work to disconnect and
            recharge is essential. In addition to country-specific holidays (12
            in the U.S. and Canada), vacation and sick time start accruing right
            away (specifics vary by country). Everyone also takes a pause together
            on quarterly all-company wellness days, plus you get to celebrate
            the most personal holiday of all: your birthday.

            Mozilla is a private company, so our compensation isn’t tied to stock
            options or equity plans. Instead, we offer generous, performance-based
            bonus plans to all regular employees to underscore that we share in
            our success as one team. As for retirement savings for US and Canadian employees,
            Mozilla contributes a percentage of your eligible base salary each year to the 401(k) Plan/RRSP
            (regardless of whether you contribute or not), with 100% vesting.

            conferences and more.

            Life is full of surprises; that’s why it’s important to be

            a safety net in place should you ever need it.
