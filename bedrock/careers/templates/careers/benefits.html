      <p>Our benefits package is world class. By offering a comprehensive, industry-leading health and wellbeing program to our employees and their families, we believe it’s easier for everyone to focus on the work we’re here to do together. Here’s a sample of what’s included in our benefits package. One thing to note: Global benefits vary by location, and a recruiter can answer specific questions if you live outside the U.S. Here’s a sampling of what we offer.</p>

          Our health plans give you the options you need to manage your health the way you want, no matter where you’re located. For our U.S. and Canadian employees, we cover the premiums for our generous medical, dental and vision plans at 100% Enrollment is also open to your eligible spouse or domestic partner and dependents under the age of 26.

        <p>
          Mental health is as important as physical health. We offer our employees access to a variety of resources — therapy, coaching, assessments and more — so they can select the care that works for them in the areas they’d like to focus on.

        <p>
          With all of life’s demands, time away from work to disconnect and recharge is essential. In addition to country-specific holidays (12 in the U.S. and Canada), vacation and sick time start accruing right away (specifics vary by country). Everyone also takes a pause together on quarterly all-company wellness days, plus you get to celebrate the most personal holiday of all: your birthday.

        <p>
          While Mozilla’s parental leave policies vary globally, our U.S. and Canadian-based employees can look forward to 26 weeks of paid leave for childbearing parents and 12 weeks of paid leave for non-childbearing parents.

        <p>
          Mozilla is a private company, so our compensation isn’t tied to stock options or equity plans. Instead, we offer generous, performance-based bonus plans to all regular employees to underscore that we share in our success as one team. As for retirement savings for U.S. and Canadian employees, Mozilla contributes a percentage of your eligible base salary each year to the 401(k) Plan/RRSP, with 100% vesting.

        <p>
          We’re big believers in learning by doing, and we also want to invest in your education and development beyond your role. Every employee is eligible for an annual professional development budget. Mozillians can put it toward technical or management training, certifications, conferences and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Life is full of surprises, that’s why it’s important to be
          prepared. Mozilla provides Life/AD&D and Short and Long Term Disability insurance to ensure that you and your family will have a safety net in place should you ever need it.

        <p>
          A few other benefits include a quarterly wellbeing stipend (to use on those things just for you), an employee referral bonus, internet reimbursement if you’re remote, and a budget for office essentials to make working remotely ergonomically comfortable.
