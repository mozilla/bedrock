    Collusion is an experimental add-on for Firefox and allows you to
    see all the third parties that are tracking your movements across
    the Web. It will show, in real time, how that data creates a
    spider-web of interaction between companies and other trackers.

    <h3>Take control of your data</h3>
    <p>
      We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is
      all about empowering users — both with tools and with
      information. The Ford Foundation is supporting Mozilla to
      develop the Collusion add-on so it will enable users to not only
      see who is tracking them across the Web, but also to turn that
      tracking off when they want to.
    </p>

    <h3>Telling the global tracking story</h3>
    <p>
      Your data can be part of the larger story. When we launch the
      full version of Collusion, it will allow you to opt-in to
      sharing your anonymous data in a global database of web tracker
      data. We’ll combine all that information and make it available
      to help researchers, journalists, and others analyze and explain
      how data is tracked on the web.
    </p>

    <h3>Building user awareness</h3>
    <p>
      Through our work with the Ford Foundation, we’ll be building
      outreach campaigns to help people understand online data
      tracking — both the benefits and the issues — so they can make
      their own choices about how they want to be tracked (or choose
      not to be tracked at all).
    </p>

    <h3>Collusion is about choice</h3>
    <p>
      Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to
      provide relevant content and enhance your online experience. But
      most tracking happens without users' consent and without their
      knowledge. That’s not okay. It should be you who decides when,
      how and if you want to be tracked. Collusion will be a powerful
      tool to help you do that.
