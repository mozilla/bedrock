Any attempt by any participant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using multiple/different email or addresses, accounts, identities, or any other methods will void that participant's entries and that participant may be disqualified.</p>
    <p>In the event of a dispute as to any entrant, the authorized account holder of the email address or Instagram account associated with the entry will be deemed to be the entrant.

A potential winner may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.
