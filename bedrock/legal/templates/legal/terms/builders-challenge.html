      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>No Purchase Necessary; Entry Instructions.</strong> NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY MONEY IS NECESSARY TO ENTER. A PURCHASE WILL NOT IMPROVE THE CHANCES OF WINNING. This is a contest of skill. Odds of winning the Challenge depend on the number and quality of eligible entries received during the Challenge Period. VOID WHERE PROHIBITED AND WHERE ANY REGISTRATION, BONDING OR LOCALIZATION REQUIRED.</p>
        <p>To enter and participate in the Challenge, you must fully complete the Challenge submission form on the Challenge page available at <a href="https://future.mozilla.org/builders-challenge/application">https://future.mozilla.org/builders-challenge/application</a>  and submit your entry as provided on the Challenge page and in these Official Rules.

        <p>In the event of a dispute as to any entrant, the authorized account holder of the email address associated with the entry will be deemed to be the entrant. The “authorized account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. A potential winner may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder. In the event of an ongoing dispute as to any entrant, Sponsor has the right to make determination as to entrant(s) in its sole discretion.</p>
        <p>For a group of individuals to enter the contest (a “Team”), the Team must agree to and designate one person as the agent of the Team to submit the entry and to accept the prize on behalf of the Team. Each individual on a Team must agree to these Official Rules. By submitting an entry, the submitter represents that all Team members have read and agreed to these Official Rules.</p>

        <p>The First Phase is judged on 3 criteria equally (Total score is out of 15). Each submission is scored 0-5 (0-LOW, 5-HIGH), the results are summed for a project score out of 15, and the applications are sorted from strongest to weakest. Any entries that do not fully complete the entry form or provide incomplete or inappropriate answers to the entry-form questions may be disqualified. The top 10 submissions become finalists and are invited to the in-person event, Second Phase.</p>
