        Firefox Private Network (“Service”) is an experimental free offering, currently limited to the United States.
        Please read these Terms of Service carefully because they explain important information about your use of
        the Service.

        If you activate this Service, Firefox will encrypt the web addresses you visit and the data you send to most
        websites. It sends this encrypted information and your IP address to our trusted partner Cloudflare, keeping
        the data private from others like your Internet Service Provider, including public wifi. Cloudflare will also
        replace your actual IP address with a Cloudflare IP address to keep your personal IP address private from
        others, such as the websites you visit and your Internet Service Provider.
