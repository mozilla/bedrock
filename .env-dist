# By default, local dev builds store CMS-uploaded media on the local system. If
# youÂ need to enable cloud storage for CMS media (likely only needed to debug or
# test that behaviour), you'll need service-account credentials which you
# must save locally in /path/to/bedrock/local-credentials/ (which is gitignored)
# Here's how to get those credentials:
# https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/gcloud.html

# GS_BUCKET_NAME="custom-media-bucket-name-here"
# GS_PROJECT_ID="meao-stevejalim-dev-sandbox"
# # export this before starting the django runserver:
# # GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./local-credentials/name-of-credentials-file.json"

# Change to True if you want to use SSO locally, else you'll use username+password auth
USE_SSO_AUTH=False

# If USE_SSO_AUTH is True, you'll be using Mozilla OpenID Connect via Auth0
# Get from IAM creentials from an appropriate person within the org to set here
# in your .env
