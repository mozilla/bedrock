// Special styling for IE8


// Newer browsers hang these styles from a '.wide' class applied by JS (else
// we assume no JS and it gets plain content without interaction).
// IE8 does support the JS so it can get the interaction, but doesn't support
// media queries so it's locked in permanent wideMode. We'll hang these from
// the '.js' class instead, which is still added by JS.

// Redeclaring all these rules is repetative and hacky and should be cleaned
// up later (or drop IE8). To future me: You should be ashamed of yourself.
// Fix this nonsense before anyone else sees it. To future devs inheriting my
// mess: I'm sorry I never got around to fixing this.
