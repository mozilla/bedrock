Firefox mobile attribution
==========================

For Firefox mobile app store referrals we use `Adjust`_, a third-party
attribution system for mobile apps that is designed to measure, optimize
and scale app growth. We use Adjust tracking links across www.mozilla.org
when we link to app stores for both Firefox and Firefox Focus on Android
and iOS. We also often embed Adjust links in QR codes that we display to
desktop visitors.

To find out more about Adjust, see the following links:

Adjust link helpers
-------------------

Whilst they are not used routinely in our pages, bedrock does have a series
of `Adjust link helpers`_ that can be used to create Adjust links for different
products.
