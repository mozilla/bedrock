# Attribution

Attribution is the practice of recording the main touch points that a website visitor encounters on their path to downloading or signing up for one of our products. It often involves a multi-step user journey, sometimes across multiple properties, but the goal is to end up with informative data that tells us where the user of a product initially came from, and what their journey looked like along the way.

These documents define how attribution works for the different products on our websites.
