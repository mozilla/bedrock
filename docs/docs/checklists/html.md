## Best Practices

- [ ] Heading levels
    - Only one h1 on the page
    - Heading levels convey the content hierarchy.
    - No heading levels skipped
- [ ] Semantic HTML
- [ ] No validation errors
- [ ] Automated a11y tests pass


## Images

- [ ] Have alt text where applicable
- [ ] Use image helpers


## Links

- [ ] No hard coded "en-US" in links to Mozilla sites
- [ ] External links have rel="external noopener"
- [ ] Destination does not 404


## SEO

- [ ] "noindex" pages should not have the canonical or hreflang tags (bug 1442331)
- [ ] Is there an appropriate page title and description?
- [ ] Page linked from subnav where applicable
