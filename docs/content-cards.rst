=================================
Using External Content Cards Data
=================================

The `www-admin repo`_ contains data files and images that are synced to
bedrock and available for use on any page. The docs for updating said
data is available via that repo, but this page will explain how to use
the cards data once it's in the bedrock database.

Add to a View
-------------

The easiest way to make the data available to a page is to add the
``page_content_cards`` variable to the template context:

.. code-block:: python

    from bedrock.contentcards.models import get_page_content_cards

    def view_with_cards(request):
        locale = l10n_utils.get_locale(request)
        ctx = {'page_content_cards': get_page_content_cards('home', locale)}
        return l10n_utils.render(request, 'sweet-words.html', ctx)

The ``get_page_content_cards`` returns a dict of card data dicts for the given page (``home`` in this case)
and locale. The dict keys are the names of the cards (e.g. ``card_1``). If the ``page_content_cards`` context
variable is available in the template, then the ``content_card()`` macro will discover it automatically.

.. note::

    The ``get_page_content_cards`` function is not all that clever as far as l10n is concerned. If you have
    translated the cards in the www-admin repo that is great, but you should have cards for every locale
    for which the page is active or the function will return an empty dict. This is especially tricky
    if you have multiple English locales enabled (en-US, en-CA, en-GB, etc.) and want the same cards to
    be used for all of them. You'd need to do something like ``if locale.startswith('en-'):`` then use
    ``en-US`` in the function call.

    Alternately you could just wrap the section of the template using cards to be optional in an
    ``{% if page_content_cards %}`` statement, and that way it will not show the section at all if the
    dict is empty if there are no cards for that page and locale combination.

Add to the Template
-------------------

Once you have the data in the template context, using a card is simple:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% from "macros-protocol.html" import content_card with context %}

    {{ content_card('card_1') }}

This will insert the data from the ``card_1.en-US.md`` file from the www-admin repo into the template
via the ``card()`` macro normally used for protocol content cards.

If you don't have the ``page_content_cards`` variable in the template context and you don't want to create or
modify a view, you can fetch the cards via a helper function in the template itself, but you have to pass the
result to the macro:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% from "macros-protocol.html" import content_card with context %}
    {% set content_cards = get_page_content_cards('home', LANG) %}

    {{ content_card('card_1', content_cards) }}
