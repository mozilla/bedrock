============
Localization
============

The site is fully localizable. Localization files are not shipped with the code
distribution, but are available in a separate GitHub repository. The proper repo
can be cloned and kept up-to-date using the ``l10n_update`` management command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_update

If you don't already have a ``locale`` directory, this command will clone the
git repo containing the translation files (either the dev or prod files
depending on your ``DEV`` setting). If the folder is already present, it will
update the repository to the latest version.

.lang files
-----------

Bedrock supports a workflow similar to gettext. You extract all the
strings from the codebase, then merge them into each locale to get
them translated.

The files containing the strings are called ".lang files" and end with
a ``.lang`` extension.

To extract all the strings from the codebase, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_extract

If you'd only like to extract strings from certain files, you may optionally
list them on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_extract apps/mozorg/templates/mozorg/contribute.html

Command line glob matching will work as well if you want all of the HTML files
in a directory, for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_extract apps/mozorg/templates/mozorg/*.html

That will use gettext to get all the needed localizations from Python
and HTML files, and will convert the result into a series of .lang
files inside ``locale/templates``. This directory represents the
"reference" set of strings to be translated, and you are free to
modify or split up .lang files here as needed (just make sure they are
being referenced correctly, from the code, see
:ref:`Which .lang file should it use? <which-lang>`).

.. _using-lang:

Translating with .lang files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To translate a string from a .lang file, simply use the gettext interface.

In a jinja2 template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    <div>{{ _('Hello, how are you?') }}<div>

    <div>{{ _('<a href="%s">Click here</a>')|format('http://mozilla.org/') }}</div>

    <div>{{ _('<a href="%(url)s">Click here</a>')|format(url='http://mozilla.org/') }}</div>

Note the usage of variable substitution in the latter examples. It is
important not to hardcode URLs or other parameters in the string.
jinja's `format` filter lets us apply variables outsite of the string.

You can provide a one-line comment to the translators like this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {# L10n: "like" as in "similar to", not "is fond of" #}
    {{ _('Like this:') }}

The comment will be included in the .lang files above the string to be
translated.

In a Python file, use ``lib.l10n_utils.dotlang._`` or
``lib.l10n_utils.dotlang._lazy``, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from lib.l10n_utils.dotlang import _lazy as _

    sometext = _('Foo about bar.')

You can provide a one-line comment to the translators like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # L10n: "like" as in "similar to", not "is fond of"
    sometext = _('Like this:')

The comment will be included in the .lang files above the string to be
translated.


There's another way to translate content within jinja2 templates. If
you need a big chunk of content translated, you can put it all inside
a `trans` block.

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% trans %}
      <div>Hello, how are you</div>
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans url='http://mozilla.org' %}
      <div><a href="{{ url }}">Click here</a></div>
    {% endtrans %}

Note that it also allows variable substitution by passing variables
into the block and using template variables to apply them.


.. _which-lang:

Which .lang file should it use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translated strings are split across several .lang files to make it
easier to manage separate projects and pages. So how does the system
know which one to use when translating a particular string?

* All translations from Python files are put into main.lang. This
  should be a very limited set of strings and most likely should be
  available to all pages.
* Templates always load `main.lang` and `download_button.lang`.
* Additionally, each template has its own .lang file, so a template at
  `mozorg/firefox.html` would use the .lang file at
  `<locale>/mozorg/firefox.lang`.
* Templates can override which .lang files are loaded. The above
  global ones are always loaded, but instead of loading
  `<locale>/mozorg/firefox.lang`, the template can specify a list of
  additional lang files to load with a template block:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% add_lang_files "foo" "bar" %}

That will make the page load `foo.lang` and `bar.lang` in addition to
`main.lang` and `download_button.lang`.

When strings are extracted from a template, they are added to the
template-specific .lang file. If the template explicitly specifies
.lang files like above, it will add the strings to the first .lang
file specified, so extracted strings from the above template would go
into `foo.lang`.

You can similarly specify extra .lang files in your Python source as well.
Simply add a module-level constant in the file named `LANG_FILES`. The
value should be either a string, or a list of strings, similar to the
`add_lang_files` tag above.

.. code-block:: python

    # forms.py

    from lib.l10n_utils.dotlang import _

    LANG_FILES = ['foo', 'bar']

    sometext = _('Foo about bar.')

This file's strings would be extracted to `foo.lang`, and the lang files
`foo.lang`, `bar.lang`, `main.lang` and `download_button.lang` would be
searched for matches in that order.

l10n blocks
------------------

Bedrock also has a block-based translation system that works like the
``{% block %}`` template tag, and marks large sections of translatable
content. This should not be used very often; lang files are the
preferred way to translate content. However, there may be times when
you want to control a large section of a page and customize it
without caring very much about future updates to the English page.

A Localizers' guide to l10n blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's look at how we would translate an example file from **English** to
**German**.

The English source template, created by a developer, lives under
`apps/appname/templates/appname/example.html` and looks like this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% extends "base-pebbles.html" %}

    {% block content %}
      <img src="someimage.jpg">

      {% l10n foo, 20110801 %}
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      {% endl10n %}

      <hr>

      {% l10n bar, 20110801 %}
      <p>This is an example!</p>
      {% endl10n %}
    {% endblock %}

The ``l10n`` blocks mark content that should be localized.
Realistically, the content in these blocks would be much larger. For a
short string like above, please use lang files. We'll use this trivial
code for our example though.

The ``l10n`` blocks are named and tagged with a date (in ISO format).
The date indicates the time that this content was updated and needs to
be translated. If you are changing trivial things, you shouldn't
update it. The point of l10n blocks is that localizers completely
customize the content, so they don't care about small updates.
However, you may add something important that needs to be added in the
localized blocks; hence, you should update the date in that case.

When the command ``./manage.py l10n_extract`` is run, it generates
the corresponding files in the ``locale`` folder (see below for more
info on this command).

The German version of this template is created at
``locale/de/templates/appname/example.html``. The contents of it are:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% extends "appname/example.html" %}

    {% l10n foo %}
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    {% endl10n %}

    {% l10n bar %}
    <p>This is an example!</p>
    {% endl10n %}

This file is an actual template for the site. It extends the main
template and contains a list of l10n blocks which override the content
on the page.

The localizer just needs to translate the content in the l10n blocks.

When the reference template is updated with new content and the date
is updated on an l10n block, the generated l10n file will simply add
the new content. It will look like this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% extends "appname/example.html" %}

    {% l10n foo %}
    <h1>This is an English string that needs translating.</h1>
    {% was %}
    <h1>Dies ist ein English string wurde nicht.</h1>
    {% endl10n %}

    {% l10n bar %}
    <p>This is an example!</p>
    {% endl10n %}

Note the ``was`` block in ``foo``. The old translated content is in
there, and the new content is above it. The ``was`` content is always
shown on the site, so the old translation still shows up. The
localizer needs to update the translated content and remove the ``was``
block.

Generating the locale files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_check

This command will check which blocks need to be translated and update
the locale templates with needed translations. It will copy the
English blocks into the locale files if a translation is needed.

You can specify a list of locales to update:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_check fr
    $ ./manage.py l10n_check fr de es

Currency
--------

When dealing with currency, make a separate gettext wrapper, placing the amount
inside a variable. You should also include a comment describing the intent. For
example:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {# L10n: Inserts a sum in US dollars, e.g. '$100'. Adapt the string in your translation for your locale conventions if needed, ex: %(sum)s US$ #}
    {{ _('$%(sum)s')|format(sum='15') }}

CSS
---

If a localized page needs some locale-specific style tweaks, you can add the
style rules to the page's stylesheet like this:

.. code-block:: css

    html[lang="it"] #features li {
      font-size: 20px;
    }

    html[dir="rtl"] #features {
      float: right;
    }

If a locale needs site-wide style tweaks, font settings in particular, you can
add the rules to ``/media/css/l10n/{{LANG}}/intl.css``. Pages on Bedrock
automatically includes the CSS in the base templates with the `l10n_css` helper
function. The CSS may also be loaded directly from other Mozilla sites with such
a URL: ``//mozorg.cdn.mozilla.net/media/css/l10n/{{LANG}}/intl.css``.

*Open Sans*, the default font on mozilla.org, doesn't offer non-Latin glyphs.
``intl.css`` can have ``@font-face`` rules to define locale-specific fonts using
custom font families as below:

* *X-LocaleSpecific-Light*: Used in combination with *Open Sans Light*. The font
  can come in 2 weights: normal and optionally bold
* *X-LocaleSpecific*: Used in combination with *Open Sans Regular*. The font can
  come in 2 weights: normal and optionally bold
* *X-LocaleSpecific-Extrabold*: Used in combination with *Open Sans Extrabold*.
  The font weight is 800 only

Here's an example of ``intl.css``:

.. code-block:: css

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific-Light;
      font-weight: normal;
      font-display: swap;
      src: local(mplus-2p-light), local(Meiryo);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific-Light;
      font-weight: bold;
      font-display: swap;
      src: local(mplus-2p-medium), local(Meiryo-Bold);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific;
      font-weight: normal;
      font-display: swap;
      src: local(mplus-2p-regular), local(Meiryo);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific;
      font-weight: bold;
      font-display: swap;
      src: local(mplus-2p-bold), local(Meiryo-Bold);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific-Extrabold;
      font-weight: 800;
      font-display: swap;
      src: local(mplus-2p-black), local(Meiryo-Bold);
    }

Localizers can specify locale-specific fonts in one of the following ways:

* Choose best-looking fonts widely used on major platforms, and specify those
  with the ``src: local(name)`` syntax
* Find a best-looking free Web font, add the font files to ``/media/fonts/``,
  and specify those with the ``src: url(path)`` syntax
* Create a custom Web font to complement missing glyphs in *Open Sans*, add the
  font files to ``/media/fonts/l10n/``, and specify those with the
  ``src: url(path)`` syntax. `M+ 2c <http://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/about-en.html>`_
  offers various international glyphs and looks similar to Open Sans, while
  `Noto Sans <https://www.google.com/get/noto/>`_ is good for the bold and
  italic variants. You can create subsets of these alternative fonts in the WOFF
  and WOFF2 formats using a tool found on the Web. See `Bug 1360812
  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360812>`_ for the Fulah (ff)
  locale's example

Developers should use the ``.open-sans`` mixin instead of ``font-family: 'Open
Sans'`` to specify the default font family in CSS. This mixin has both *Open
Sans* and *X-LocaleSpecific* so locale-specific fonts, if defined, will be
applied to localized pages. The variant mixins, ``.open-sans-light`` and
``.open-sans-extrabold``, are also available.

Staging Copy Changes
--------------------

The need will often arise to push a copy change to production before the new
copy has been translated for all locales. To prevent locales not yet translated
from displaying English text, you can use the ``l10n_has_tag`` template
function. For example, if the string "Firefox features" needs to be changed to
"Firefox benefits":

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% if l10n_has_tag('firefox_products_headline_spring_2016') %}
      <h1>{{ _('Firefox features') }}</h1>
    {% else %}
      <h1>{{ _('Firefox benefits') }}</h1>
    {% endif %}

This function will check the .lang file(s) of the current page for the tag
``firefox_products_headline_spring_2016``. If it exists, the translation for
"Firefox features" will be displayed. If not, the pre-existing translation for
"Firefox benefits" will be displayed.

When using ``l10n_has_tag``, be sure to coordinate with the localization team to
decide on a good tag name. Always use underscores instead of hyphens if you need
to visually separate words.

Locale-specific Templates
-------------------------

While the ``l10n_has_tag`` template function is great in small doses, it doesn't
scale particularly well. A template filled with conditional copy can be
difficult to comprehend, particularly when the conditional copy has associated
CSS and/or JavaScript.

In instances where a large amount of a template's copy needs to be changed, or
when a template has messaging targeting one particular locale, creating a
locale-specific template may be a good choice.

Locale-specific templates function simply by naming convention. For example, to
create a version of ``/firefox/new.html`` specifically for the ``de`` locale,
you would create a new template named ``/firefox/new.de.html``. This template
can either extend ``/firefox/new.html`` and override only certain blocks, or be
entirely unique.

When a request is made for a particular page, bedrock's rendering function
automatically checks for a locale-specific template, and, if one exists, will
render it instead of the originally specified (locale-agnostic) template.

.. NOTE::

    Creating a locale-specific template for en-US was not possible when this
    feature was introduced, but it is now. So you can create your en-US-only
    template and the rest of the locales will continue to use the default.

.. IMPORTANT::

    Note that the presence of an L10n template (e.g.
    ``locale/de/templates/firefox/new.html``) will take precedence over
    a locale-specific template in bedrock.


Specifying Active Locales in Views
----------------------------------

Normally we rely on activation tags in our translation files (.lang files)
to determine in which languages a page will be available. This will almost always
be what we want for a page. But sometimes we need to explicitly state the locales
available for a page. The `impressum` page for example is only available in German
and the template itself has German hard-coded into it since we don't need it to be
translated into any other languages. In cases like these we can send a list of locale
codes with the template context and it will be the final list. This can be accomplished
in a few ways depending on how the view is coded.

For a plain view function, you can simply pass a list of locale codes to `l10n_utils.render`
in the context using the name `active_locales`. This will be the full list of available
translations. Use `add_active_locales` if you want to add languages to the existing list:

.. code-block:: python

    def french_and_german_only(request):
        return l10n_utils.render(request, 'home.html', {'active_locales': ['de', 'fr'])

If you don't need a custom view and are just using the `page()` helper function in your `urls.py`
file, then you can similarly pass in a list:

.. code-block:: python

    page('about', 'about.html', active_locales=['en-US', 'es-ES']),

Or if your view is even more fancy and you're using a Class-Based-View that inherits from `LangFilesMixin`
(which it must if you want it to be translated) then you can specify the list as part of the view Class
definition:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyView(LangFilesMixin, View):
        active_locales = ['zh-CN', 'hi-IN']

Or in the `urls.py` when using a CBV:

.. code-block:: python

    url(r'about/$', MyView.as_view(active_locales=['de', 'fr'])),

The main thing to keep in mind is that if you specify `active_locales` that will be the full list of
localizations available for that page. If you'd like to add to the existing list of locales generated
from the lang files then you can use the `add_active_locales` name in all of the same ways as
`active_locales` above. It's a list of locale codes that will be added to the list already available.
This is useful in situations where we would have needed the l10n team to create an empty .lang file with
an active tag in it because we have a locale-specific-template with text in the language hard-coded into
the template and therefore do not otherwise need a .lang file.

Development
-----------

In local development environments and on demo servers all ``l10n_has_tag`` calls
evaluate to true. If the content has not been translated it will display
the English strings.

To test l10n locally you can set ``DEV=False`` in your ``.env`` file.

If you are running your local server you will need to restart it after altering
your ``.env`` file.
