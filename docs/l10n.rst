Localization
============

The site is fully localizable. Localization files are not shipped with the code
distribution, but are available on SVN:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git svn clone https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/trunk/locales/ locale
    # or
    $ svn checkout https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/trunk/locales/ locale

.lang files
-----------

Bedrock supports a workflow similar to gettext. You extract all the
strings from the codebase, then merge them into each locale to get
them translated.

The files containing the strings are called ".lang files" and end with
a ``.lang`` extension.

To extract all the strings from the codebase, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_extract

If you'd only like to extract strings from certain files, you may optionally
list them on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_extract apps/mozorg/templates/mozorg/contribute.html

Command line glob matching will work as well if you want all of the html files
in a directory for example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_extract apps/mozorg/templates/mozorg/*.html

That will use gettext to get all the needed localizations from python
and html files, and will convert the result into a bunch of .lang
files inside ``locale/templates``. This directory represents the
"reference" set of strings to be translated, and you are free to
modify or split up .lang files here as needed (just make sure they are
being referenced correctly, from the code, see
:ref:`Which .lang file should it use? <which-lang>`).

To merge new strings into locale directories, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_merge

If you want to merge only specific locales, you can pass any number of
them as arguments:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_merge fr de


.. _using-lang:

Translating with .lang files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To translate a string from a .lang file, simply use the gettext interface.

In a jinja2 template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    <div>{{ _('Hello, how are you?') }}<div>

    <div>{{ _('<a href="%s">Click here</a>')|format('http://mozilla.org/') }}</div>

    <div>{{ _('<a href="%(url)s">Click here</a>')|format(url='http://mozilla.org/') }}</div>

Note the usage of variable substitution in the latter examples. It is
important not to hardcode URLs or other parameters in the string.
jinja's `format` filter lets us apply variables outsite of the string.

You can provide a one-line comment to the translators like this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {# L10n: "like" as in "similar to", not "is fond of" #}
    {{ _('Like this:') }}

The comment will be included in the .lang files above the string to be
translated.

In a Python file, use ``lib.l10n_utils.dotlang._`` or
``lib.l10n_utils.dotlang._lazy``, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from lib.l10n_utils.dotlang import _lazy as _

    sometext = _('Foo about bar.')

You can provide a one-line comment to the translators like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # L10n: "like" as in "similar to", not "is fond of"
    sometext = _('Like this:')

The comment will be included in the .lang files above the string to be
translated.


There's another way to translate content within jinja2 templates. If
you need a big chunk of content translated, you can put it all inside
a `trans` block.

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% trans %}
      <div>Hello, how are you</div>
    {% endtrans %}

    {% trans url='http://mozilla.org' %}
      <div><a href="{{ url }}">Click here</a></div>
    {% endtrans %}

Note that it also allows variable substitution by passing variables
into the block and using template variables to apply them.

A general good practice is to enclose short strings in l10n calls (trans blocks or gettext wrapper). If you have a paragraph with several sentences, it is better to wrap each sentence in its own call than the whole paragraph. That makes it more digestable for localizers and avoids having a whole paragraph invalidated for a change to one sentence only.

Example:

.. code-block:: jinja

    <p>
    {{_('As a result, more countries and mobile phone operators will be selling Firefox in the future.')}}
    {{_('Our operator partners will distribute the phones through a variety of locally-specific channels.')}}
    </p>


.. _which-lang:

Which .lang file should it use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translated strings are split across several .lang files to make it
easier to manage separate projects and pages. So how does the system
know which one to use when translating a particular string?

* All translations from Python files are put into main.lang. This
  should be a very limited set of strings and most likely should be
  available to all pages.
* Templates always load in `main.lang`, `download_button.lang`, and `newsletter.lang`
* Additionally, each template has its own .lang file, so a template at
  `mozorg/firefox.html` would use the .lang file at
  `<locale>/mozorg/firefox.lang`.
* Templates can override which lang files are loaded. The above 3
  global ones are always loaded, but instead of loading
  `<locale>/mozorg/firefox.lang`, the template can specify a list of
  additional lang files to load with a template block:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% add_lang_files "foo" "bar" %}

That will make the page load `foo.lang` and `bar.lang` in addition to
`main.lang`, `download_button.lang`, and `newsletter.lang`.

When strings are extracted from a template, that are added to the
template-specific .lang file. If the template explicitly specifies
.lang files like above, it will add the strings to the first .lang
file specified, so extracted strings from the above template would go
into `foo.lang`.

You can similarly specify extra lang files in your Python source as well.
Simply add a module-level constant in the file named `LANG_FILES`. The
value should be either a string, or a list of strings, similar to the
`add_lang_files` tag above.

.. code-block:: python

    # forms.py

    from lib.l10n_utils.dotlang import _

    LANG_FILES = ['foo', 'bar']

    sometext = _('Foo about bar.')

This file's strings would be extracted to `foo.lang`, and the lang files
`foo.lang`, `bar.lang`, `main.lang`, `download_button.lang`, and `newsletter.lang`
would be searched for matches in that order.

l10n blocks
------------------

Bedrock also has a block-based translation system that works like the
``{% block %}`` template tag, and marks large sections of translatable
content. This should not be used very often; lang files are the
preferred way to translate content. However, there may be times when
you want to control a large section of a page and customize it
without caring very much about future updates to the English page.

A Localizers' guide to l10n blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's look at how we would translate an example file from **English** to
**German**.

The English source template, created by a developer, lives under
`apps/appname/templates/appname/example.html` and looks like this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% extends "base.html" %}

    {% block content %}
      <img src="someimage.jpg">

      {% l10n foo, 20110801 %}
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      {% endl10n %}

      <hr>

      {% l10n bar, 20110801 %}
      <p>This is an example!</p>
      {% endl10n %}
    {% endblock %}

The ``l10n`` blocks mark content that should be localized.
Realistically, the content in these blocks would be much larger. For a
short string like above, please use lang files. We'll use this trivial
code for our example though.

The ``l10n`` blocks are named and tagged with a date (in ISO format).
The date indicates the time that this content was updated and needs to
be translated. If you are changing trivial things, you shouldn't
update it. The point of l10n blocks is that localizers completely
customize the content, so they don't care about small updates.
However, you may add something important that needs to be added in the
localized blocks; hence, you should update the date in that case.

When the command ``./manage.py l10n_extract`` is run, it generates
the corresponding files in the ``locale`` folder (see below for more
info on this command).

The german version of this template is created at
``locale/de/templates/appname/example.html``. The contents of it are:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% extends "appname/example.html" %}

    {% l10n foo %}
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    {% endl10n %}

    {% l10n bar %}
    <p>This is an example!</p>
    {% endl10n %}

This file is an actual template for the site. It extends the main
template and contains a list of l10n blocks which override the content
on the page.

The localizer just needs to translate the content in the l10n blocks.

When the reference template is updated with new content and the date
is updated on an l10n block, the generated l10n file will simply add
the new content. It will look like this:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% extends "appname/example.html" %}

    {% l10n foo %}
    <h1>This is an English string that needs translating.</h1>
    {% was %}
    <h1>Dies ist ein English string wurde nicht.</h1>
    {% endl10n %}

    {% l10n bar %}
    <p>This is an example!</p>
    {% endl10n %}

Note the ``was`` block in ``foo``. The old translated content is in
there, and the new content is above it. The ``was`` content is always
shown on the site, so the old translation still shows up. The
localizer needs to update the translated content and remove the ``was``
block.

Generating the locale files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_check

This command will check which blocks need to be translated and update
the locale templates with needed translations. It will copy the
English blocks into the locale files if a translation is needed.

You can specify a list of locales to update:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./manage.py l10n_check fr
    $ ./manage.py l10n_check fr de es

CSS
---

If a localized page needs some locale-specific style tweaks, you can add the
style rules to the page's stylesheet like this:

    html[lang="it"] {
      #features li {
        font-size: 20px;
      }
    }

    html[dir="rtl"] {
      #features {
        float: right;
      }
    }

If a locale needs site-wide style tweaks, font settings in particular, you can
add the rules to ``/media/css/l10n/{{LANG}}/intl.css``. Pages on Bedrock
automatically includes the CSS in the base templates with the `l10n_css` helper
function. The CSS may also be loaded directly from other Mozilla sites with such
a URL: ``//mozorg.cdn.mozilla.net/media/css/l10n/{{LANG}}/intl.css``.

*Open Sans*, the default font on mozilla.org, doesn't offer non-Latin glyphs.
``intl.css`` can have ``@font-face`` rules to define locale-specific fonts using
custom font families as below:

* *X-LocaleSpecific-Light*: Used in combination with *Open Sans Light*. The font
  can come in 2 weights: normal and optionally bold
* *X-LocaleSpecific*: Used in combination with *Open Sans Regular*. The font can
  come in 2 weights: normal and optionally bold
* *X-LocaleSpecific-Extrabold*: Used in combination with *Open Sans Extrabold*.
  The font weight is 800 only

Here's an example of ``intl.css``:

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific-Light;
      font-weight: normal;
      src: local(mplus-2p-light), local(Meiryo);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific-Light;
      font-weight: bold;
      src: local(mplus-2p-medium), local(Meiryo-Bold);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific;
      font-weight: normal;
      src: local(mplus-2p-regular), local(Meiryo);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific;
      font-weight: bold;
      src: local(mplus-2p-bold), local(Meiryo-Bold);
    }

    @font-face {
      font-family: X-LocaleSpecific-Extrabold;
      font-weight: 800;
      src: local(mplus-2p-black), local(Meiryo-Bold);
    }

Localizers can specify locale-specific fonts in one of the following ways:

* Choose best-looking fonts widely used on major platforms, and specify those
with the ``src: local(name)`` syntax
* Find a best-looking free Web font, add the font files to ``/media/fonts/``,
and specify those with the ``src: url(path)`` syntax
* Create a custom Web font to complement missing glyphs in *Open Sans*, add the
font files to ``/media/fonts/``, and specify those with the ``src: url(path)``
syntax. The `M+ font family
<http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/index-en.html>`_ offers
various international glyphs and looks similar to *Open Sans*. You can create a
subset of the *M+ 2c* font using a tool found on the Web. See `Bug 776967
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=776967>`_ for the Fulah (ff)
locale's example.

Developers should use the ``.open-sans`` mixin instead of ``font-family: 'Open
Sans'`` to specify the default font family in CSS. This mixin has both *Open
Sans* and *X-LocaleSpecific* so locale-specific fonts, if defined, will be
applied to localized pages. The variant mixins, ``.open-sans-light`` and
``.open-sans-extrabold``, are also available.
