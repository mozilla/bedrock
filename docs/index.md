title: Welcome to Bedrock's documentation!
---

**bedrock** is the project behind www.mozilla.org. It is as shiny,
awesome, and open-source as always. Perhaps even a little more.

bedrock is a web application based on
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), a
[Python](https://www.python.org) web application framework.

Patches are welcome! Feel free to fork and contribute to this project on
[Github](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock).
