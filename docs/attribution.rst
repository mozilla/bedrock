Attribution

Attribution is the practice of recording the main touch points that a
website visitor encounters on their path to downloading or signing up
for one of our products. It often involves a multi-step user journey,
sometimes across multiple properties, but the goal is to end up with
informative data that tells us where the user of a product initially
came from, and what their journey looked like along the way.

These documents define how attribution works for the different
products on our websites.
