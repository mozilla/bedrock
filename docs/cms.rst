====================
CMS capability (WIP)
====================

From 2024, Bedrock's CMS will be powered by `Wagtail CMS`_.

This page is currently a skeleton for documentation to be added as the work evolves.

High-level summary
------------------

Wagtail CMS will be used to make either entire pages or portions of pages (let's
call them 'surfaces') content-editable on www.mozilla.org. It is not a free-for-all
add-any-page-you-like approach, but rather a careful rollout of surfaces with
appropriate guard rails that helps ensure the integrity, quality and security of
www.mozilla.org.

Surfaces will be authored via a closed 'Editing' deployment and when those changes
are published they will become visible on the main www.mozilla.org 'Web' deployment.
