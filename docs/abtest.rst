A/B Testing
=================

A/B testing on bedrock is done with the help of `Traffic Cop
<https://github.com/mozilla/trafficcop/>`_. A small javascript library which will
direct site traffic to different variants in a/b experiments and make sure a
visitor always sees the same variation.

It's possible to test more than 2 variants.

Traffic Cop sends users to experiments and then we use Google Analytics (GA) to
analyze which variation is more successful. (If the user has DNT enabled they
do not participate in experiments.)

All a/b tests should have a `mana page <https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/EN/Details+of+experiments+by+mozilla.org+team>`_
detailing the experiment and recording the results.

Coding the variants
-------------------

Traffic cop supports two methods of a/b testing. Executing different on page
javascript or  redirecting to the same URL with a query string appended. We
mostly use the redirect method in bedrock. This makes testing easier.

Create a `variation view <http://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coding.html#variation-views>`_
for the a/b test.

The view can handle the url redirect in one of two ways:

#. the same page, with some different content based on the `variation` variable
#. a totally different page

Content variation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Useful for small focused tests.

This is explained on the `variation view <http://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coding.html#variation-views>`_
page.

New page
~~~~~~~~

Useful for large page changes where content and assets are dramatically
different.

Create the variant page like you would a new page. Make sure it is ``noindex``
and does not have a ``canonical`` url.

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% block canonical_urls %}<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">{% endblock %}


Configure as explained on the `variation view <http://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coding.html#variation-views>`_
page.

Traffic Cop
-----------

Create a .js file where you initialize Traffic Cop and include that in the
experiments block in the template that will be doing the redirection. Wrap the
extra js include in a `switch <http://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#feature-flipping-aka-switches>`_.

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% block experiments %}
      {% if switch('experiment-berlin-video', ['de']) %}
        {{ js_bundle('firefox_new_berlin_experiment') }}
      {% endif %}
    {% endblock %}

Switches
~~~~~~~~

See the traffic cop section of the `switch docs <http://bedrock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#feature-flipping-aka-switches>`_ for instructions.

Recording the data
------------------

Including the ``data-ex-variant`` and ``data-ex-name`` in the analytics
reporting will add the test to an auto generated report in GA. The variable
values may be provided by the analytics team.

.. code-block:: javascript

    if(href.indexOf('v=a') !== -1) {
        window.dataLayer.push({
            'data-ex-variant': 'de-page',
            'data-ex-name': 'Berlin-Campaign-Landing-Page'
        });
    } else if (href.indexOf('v=b') !== -1) {
        window.dataLayer.push({
            'data-ex-variant': 'campaign-page',
            'data-ex-name': 'Berlin-Campaign-Landing-Page'
        });
    }

Make sure any buttons and interaction which are being compared as part of the
test and will report into GA.

Tests
-----

Write some tests for your a/b test. This could be simple or complex depending
on the experiment.

Some things to consider checking:

- Requests for the default (non variant) page call the correct template.
- Requests for a variant page call the correct template.
- Locales excluded from the test call the correct (default) template.
