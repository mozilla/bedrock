vpn-what-is-what-is-a-vpn = What is a VPN?

# HTML page description and intro
vpn-what-is-get-answers-to-nine = Get answers to nine common questions about VPNs so you feel informed on what they do, when to use one and why.

vpn-what-is-many-of-us = Many of us spend multiple hours a day using the internet to do everyday things like watching videos, shopping, gaming and paying bills, all the way to managing complex work projects and having confidential video calls. A <strong>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong> is one of the best ways to stay private and secure online, and keep your personal data protected.
vpn-what-is-how-do-vpns = How do VPNs work?
vpn-what-is-a-vpn-is = A VPN is a tool that allows you to access the internet securely wherever you are. A VPN works by creating a secure “tunnel” between your device and your VPN provider, and it protects you in two key ways:
vpn-what-is-concealing-your-ip = Concealing your IP address, protecting your identity and location.
vpn-what-is-encrypting-your-traffic = Encrypting your traffic between you and your VPN provider so that no one on your local network can decipher or modify it.
vpn-what-is-in-the-past = In the past, VPNs were mainly used by corporations to allow secure remote access to their internal services and proprietary data. Now, however, VPNs are available to anyone who wants to protect their connection to the internet, especially when it’s over porous networks like public WiFi, but it’s even useful on a home network.
vpn-what-is-a-vpn-will = A VPN will protect traffic that you send between you and your VPN provider, whether through your browser, apps or other services. To set up a VPN, you’ll need to create an account with a VPN provider and install the VPN software on your computer or phone. When enabled, a VPN will handle traffic from all apps and software running on your device, so you can browse and communicate freely over a secure private network connection.

#   $countries (number) - number of countries where Mozilla VPN has servers, e.g. "30"
vpn-what-is-a-vpn-provider = A VPN provider typically offers a number of connection gateways in different global locations, which allows you to use an IP address from a locale different from your own. That way, the place you’re connecting to sees the VPN’s IP, not your actual IP address, as the source of your traffic. <a href="{ $mozvpn }">{ -brand-name-mozilla-vpn }</a> routes your traffic through a secure server and lets you choose a location from more than { $countries } countries.
vpn-what-is-when-should-i = When should I use a VPN?
vpn-what-is-connecting-to-a = Connecting to a public WiFi network is at times convenient, like when you’re without internet service or can’t get any bars on your phone. On the other hand, connecting to public WiFi can be a risky endeavor. It’s impossible to be sure that someone else isn’t connecting to the same network to snoop on what you’re doing. Even if your traffic is encrypted they can still see which sites you are visiting. And if you’re using an app that doesn’t have encryption — and even today, many don’t — then they can see everything you are doing.
vpn-what-is-when-youre-at = When you’re at home, the risk of bad actors showing up on your home network is lower. However, your internet service provider (ISP) can track and share your online activities because all the data that you access on the web is routed through your ISP’s network, some of which may not be encrypted. A VPN can prevent ISPs from spying on you by encrypting your traffic to your VPN provider no matter where you are.
vpn-what-is-wait-i-thought = Wait, I thought my internet traffic was already encrypted with HTTPS…
vpn-what-is-its-true-that = It’s true that most connections to websites these days are secured by HTTPS, which means the content, but not the source or destination IP address, is encrypted. A VPN offers additional privacy by preventing websites and third parties from learning your IP address.
vpn-what-is-why-would-i = Why would I use a VPN?
vpn-what-is-hiding-your-identity = Hiding your identity and cloaking your web traffic can seem like something only the super tech savvy or shady actors do. However, there are a number of legitimate reasons you may want to use a VPN, including:
vpn-what-is-keeping-your-online = Keeping your online activity private.
vpn-what-is-keeping-your-home = Keeping your home location or commonly visited places private.
vpn-what-is-protecting-your-connection = Protecting your connection to a public WiFi network, like at a cafe, airport, store or library.
vpn-what-is-ensuring-the-confidentiality = Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your access to the internet.
vpn-what-is-make-it-more = Make it more difficult for ad networks to use your IP to create ad targeting profiles that track you across the web.
vpn-what-is-what-are-the = What are the downsides of using a VPN?
vpn-what-is-some-service-providers = Some service providers block visits made through VPNs, making their content inaccessible when a VPN is turned on. Some VPNs can slow you down, or they might restrict your bandwidth. And some VPNs rank poorly in terms of respecting user privacy and security.
vpn-what-is-are-vpns-safe = Are VPNs safe?
vpn-what-is-its-very-hard = It’s very hard to find a trustworthy VPN. VPNs are intended to protect users while they’re online, but not all VPNs are equal in the service they deliver. When shopping around for a VPN service, be sure you understand the terms you’re agreeing to. Many claim to be great and focused on privacy, but a large number of them fall short on their promise. Some VPNs will log your online activities so they can sell your data and information to marketing firms themselves. Other VPNs will try to convince you to install malware on your devices.
