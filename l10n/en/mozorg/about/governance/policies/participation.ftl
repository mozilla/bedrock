participation-version-31-updated = Version 3.1 – Updated January 16, 2020
participation-the-heart-of-mozilla = The heart of { -brand-name-mozilla } is people. We put people first and do our best to recognize, appreciate and respect the diversity of our global contributors. The { -brand-name-mozilla } Project welcomes contributions from everyone who shares our goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner within our community. As such, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all those who participate to agree and adhere to these Community Participation Guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.
participation-these-guidelines-aim = These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:
participation-background = Background
participation-family-status = Family status
participation-gender = Gender
participation-gender-identity-or = Gender identity or expression
participation-marital-status = Marital status
participation-sex = Sex

participation-native-language = Native language
participation-age = Age
participation-ability = Ability
participation-race-andor-ethnicity = Race and/or ethnicity
participation-caste = Caste

participation-geographic-location = Geographic location
participation-any-other-dimension = Any other dimension of diversity
participation-openness-collaboration = Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work — from development on { -brand-name-firefox } to collaboratively designing curriculum. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.
participation-when-and-how-to-use = When and How to Use These Guidelines
participation-these-guidelines-outline = These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of the { -brand-name-mozilla } community in all { -brand-name-mozilla } activities, both offline and online. Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all { -brand-name-mozilla } activities, including but not limited to:
participation-working-in-mozilla = Working in { -brand-name-mozilla } spaces.
participation-working-with-other = Working with other Mozillians and other { -brand-name-mozilla } community participants virtually or co-located.
participation-representing-mozilla = Representing { -brand-name-mozilla } at public events.
participation-representing-mozilla-social = Representing { -brand-name-mozilla } in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, { -brand-name-facebook } pages).
participation-participating-in-mozilla = Participating in { -brand-name-mozilla } offsites and trainings.
participation-participating-in-mozilla-related = Participating in { -brand-name-mozilla }-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person meetings, and { -brand-name-mozilla }-related correspondence.

The Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy is crafted with specific legal definitions and requirements in mind.
participation-while-these-guidelines = While these guidelines / code of conduct are specifically aimed at { -brand-name-mozilla }’s work and community, we recognize that it is possible for actions taken outside of { -brand-name-mozilla }’s online or in person spaces to have a deep impact on community health. (For example, in the past, we publicly identified an anonymous posting aimed at a { -brand-name-mozilla } employee in a non-{ -brand-name-mozilla } forum as clear grounds for removal from the { -brand-name-mozilla } community.) This is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities about appropriate boundaries.
participation-expected-behavior = Expected Behavior
participation-the-following-behaviors = The following behaviors are expected of all Mozillians:
participation-be-respectful = Be Respectful
participation-value-each-others = Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.
participation-be-direct-but-professional = Be Direct but Professional
participation-we-are-likely-to-have = We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We <em>must</em> be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.
participation-be-inclusive = Be Inclusive
participation-seek-diverse-perspectives = Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.
participation-be-inclusive-of-everyone = Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:
participation-remote-on-video-or = Remote (on video or phone)
participation-not-native-language = Not native language speakers

participation-understand-different = Understand Different Perspectives
participation-our-goal-should-not = Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.
participation-appreciate-and-accommodate = Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences
participation-mozillians-come-from = Mozillians come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Mozillians to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.
participation-lead-by-example = Lead by Example
participation-by-matching-your-actions = By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion.

participation-conflicts-will-inevitably = Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others.

participation-hurtful-or-harmful = Hurtful or harmful language related to:
