compare-opera-operas-privacy-policy-lacks = { -brand-name-opera }’s privacy policy lacks some specificity in its explanation of which types of information it collects and how. In certain sections, it says they collect names of account holders, IP addresses and search terms. What seems confusing and troubling is the section about international data transfers; when, how often and why they need to transfer your data internationally is not explained.

While { -brand-name-opera } has not reached the same level of user adoption as { -brand-name-firefox } or { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome }, it’s maintained a relatively stable and loyal base over a sustained period of time. In this review, we’ll compare the { -brand-name-opera } browser with our { -brand-name-firefox } browser in terms of security and privacy, utility, and portability to help you choose which browser might be the best fit for you.

compare-opera-as-far-as-actual-privacy-protections = As far as actual privacy protections in the { -brand-name-opera } browser, it does offer a robust Private mode that allows you to surf the web without the browser tracking your activity. Also in normal browsing mode, you can also turn off some data collection features by digging into the settings to enable the ad blocker and adjust other security features.

# Variables:
#   $attrs (string) - link to https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/03/todays-firefox-blocks-third-party-tracking-cookies-and-cryptomining-by-default/ with additional attributes for analytics
compare-opera-with-the-latest-version-of = With the latest version of { -brand-name-firefox }, <a { $attrs }>Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> is turned on by default in normal browsing mode, so you don’t have to mess around with the settings just to protect yourself from trackers.

compare-opera-we-make-firefox-for-people = We make { -brand-name-firefox } for people like you, who care deeply about personal privacy and security. That's why we collect so little info about users and are transparent about how we use that info. It's hard to know how { -brand-name-opera } is operating from a privacy perspective. While there are robust privacy features, how they themselves collect and share your data is murky. { -brand-name-firefox } remains consistent in what we say and what we do in protecting your privacy.

# Variables:
#   $attrs (string) - link to addons.mozilla.org with additional attributes for analytics
compare-opera-theres-no-debate-that-opera = There’s no debate that { -brand-name-opera } is a feature-packed browser with a clean user interface and strong customization options. Because { -brand-name-opera } is built on { -brand-name-chromium }, it can take advantage of most of { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome }’s vast extension library. { -brand-name-firefox } also features a large <a { $attrs }>extension library to browse</a>, but not quite as large as { -brand-name-chrome }’s.
compare-opera-like-firefox-opera-delivers = Like { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-opera } delivers a scrolling tab experience, which means that when you open more tabs than will fit on screen, it scrolls them off screen instead of just continuously shrinking them down. Also both { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-opera } have a screenshot tool that lets you capture a snapshot of your screen or part of the page. However, the { -brand-name-opera } tool doesn’t give you the ability to create one huge capture of the whole webpage, only the visible portion.

# Variables:
#   $attrs (string) - link to /firefox/pocket/ with additional attributes for analytics
# "Facebook Messenger" is a brand name.
compare-opera-opera-provides-a-lot-of-hidden = { -brand-name-opera } provides a lot of hidden utility within its simple and manageable interface. For example there’s built-in support for messaging apps, like { -brand-name-facebook } Messenger. There’s also a news reader that aggregates articles from your choice of sites and news outlets. The parallel feature to this on { -brand-name-firefox } is called <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-pocket }</a>. { -brand-name-pocket } is a free service for { -brand-name-firefox } account holders that makes it easy to find and save interesting articles and videos from all around the web. In addition, it recommends a variety of articles that expand your knowledge base curated by real, thoughtful humans.
compare-opera-in-terms-of-head-to-head-utility = In terms of head to head utility, { -brand-name-opera } and { -brand-name-firefox } are close competitors. { -brand-name-opera } may have an advantage in one aspect with its compatibility with and access to { -brand-name-chrome }’s huge extension library. But one significant factor to consider is the fact that { -brand-name-opera }, because it’s built on { -brand-name-chromium }, is a processor-hungry browser with its RAM consumption comparable to { -brand-name-chrome }, which is known for its high CPU usage.

# "Ex" is a former partner or spouse, as in "ex-boyfriend" or "ex-wife." Alternative: "former partner"
compare-opera-both-firefox-and-opera-are = Both { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-opera } are compatible across every platform including { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, { -brand-name-linux }, { -brand-name-android } and { -brand-name-ios }. { -brand-name-firefox } account holders can easily sync their bookmarks, passwords, open tabs, and browsing history across all their signed into devices. The same is true for { -brand-name-opera } users with an account. However, many sites, especially old sites that haven’t been updated in years, block the latest version of { -brand-name-opera } entirely. So if visiting places like your Ex’s old blog is important, take heed, you may not be able to access some of the dustier corners of the internet if you use { -brand-name-opera }.

# "Touch" and "Mini" are brand names.
compare-opera-in-addition-to-the-regular = In addition to the regular mobile app, { -brand-name-opera } has two other mobile versions of its browser: Touch and Mini. Touch is light on features but it’s designed to use on the go with only one hand. The Mini version aims at lowering data usage and increased speeds on slow connections by downgrading images and stripping away content.

compare-opera-overall-opera-is-a-solid-browser = Overall, { -brand-name-opera } is a solid browser, with a clean interface and a lot of useful features available. There are, however, some serious privacy concerns as well as an issue with it using a lot of processing power. Although { -brand-name-opera } has some really terrific ease of use features, we still believe { -brand-name-firefox } remains a superior browser based on performance and with a transparent user-privacy stance and strict privacy protections.
