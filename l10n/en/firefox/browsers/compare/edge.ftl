# HTML page description.

# Main title.
compare-edge-comparing-firefox-browser-with = Comparing { -brand-name-firefox-browser } with { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-edge }

compare-edge-with-windows-10-microsoft-introduced-updated = With { -brand-name-windows } 10, { -brand-name-microsoft } introduced its { -brand-name-edge } browser to compete with { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-chrome }, making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and { -brand-name-microsoft } eventually announced plans to relaunch { -brand-name-edge } as a { -brand-name-chromium }-based browser ({ -brand-name-chromium } is { -brand-name-google }’s Open Source browser project). Since January of 2020, { -brand-name-microsoft }’s { -brand-name-chromium }-based { -brand-name-edge } has replaced the previous versions of { -brand-name-edge }. Although { -brand-name-edge } is now built on { -brand-name-google }’s { -brand-name-chromium }, a number of unique features do set it apart from { -brand-name-google }’s { -brand-name-chrome } browser.

# "Out of the gate" means from the very start. Alternative: "From the start,". Race horses are held behind a gate that is opened to release all the horses at the same time at the start of the race, so a horse that leads the race from the very start is said to lead "right out of the gate."
compare-edge-out-of-the-gate-firefox-has = Out of the gate, { -brand-name-firefox } has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, { -brand-name-edge }’s compatibility with { -brand-name-google }’s { -brand-name-chromium } platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.

compare-edge-with-internet-explorer-microsoft = With { -brand-name-ie }, { -brand-name-microsoft } learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made { -brand-name-edge } readily available on { -brand-name-ios }, { -brand-name-android }, { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, and soon { -brand-name-linux }.

# Variables:
#   $attrs (string) - link to /firefox/accounts/ with additional attributes for analytics
compare-edge-firefox-has-been-available = { -brand-name-firefox } has been available on { -brand-name-ios }, { -brand-name-android }, { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac } and { -brand-name-linux } for years.

It’s our assessment that { -brand-name-firefox } is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-mozilla }</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.
compare-edge-the-bottom-line-is-that-while = The bottom line is that while we suggest using { -brand-name-firefox }, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
