compare-edge-with-windows-10-microsoft-introduced = With { -brand-name-windows } 10, { -brand-name-microsoft } introduced its { -brand-name-edge } browser to compete with { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-chrome } making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and { -brand-name-microsoft } eventually announced plans to relaunch { -brand-name-edge } as a { -brand-name-chromium }-based browser ({ -brand-name-chromium } of course being Google’s Open Source browser project).
compare-edge-here-well-compare-our-firefox = Here we’ll compare our { -brand-name-firefox-browser } to the { -brand-name-chromium }-based { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-edge } in terms of privacy, utility, and portability, to help you have a better understanding of which browser better suits your needs and preferences.

# "SmartScreen" and "Windows Hello" are brand names.

It has a built-in SmartScreen that scans the reputation of sites you visit and blocks suspicious sites. To enhance privacy, { -brand-name-edge } allows you to use biometrics or a PIN with { -brand-name-edge } Hello instead of passwords for online authentication.

Our <a { $attrs }>privacy policy</a> is transparent and in plain language. We actually put a lot of work into making sure it was straightforward and easy to read. With Enhanced Tracking Protection now on by default, we block 2000+ trackers automatically. Trackers are those little pieces of code that try to piece together what you're doing across multiple internet sites to build a composite and detailed picture of who you are, compromising your privacy all just to target better ads.

Plus with { -brand-name-pocket }, you can also save articles, videos, and other content with one click, for reading at a later time.
compare-edge-firefox-and-edge-both-offer = { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-edge } both offer excellent reading modes.

# "Out of the gate" means from the very start. Alternative: "From the start,". Race horses are held behind a gate that is opened to release all the horses at the same time at the start of the race, so a horse that leads the race from the very start is said to lead "right out of the gate."
compare-edge-out-of-the-gate-firefox-has = Out of the gate, { -brand-name-firefox } has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, { -brand-name-edge }’s compatibility with { -brand-name-google }’s { -brand-name-chromium } platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.

compare-edge-with-internet-explorer-microsoft = With { -brand-name-ie }, { -brand-name-microsoft } learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made { -brand-name-edge } readily available on { -brand-name-ios }, { -brand-name-android }, { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, and soon { -brand-name-linux }.
compare-edge-with-internet-explorer-fallback = With { -brand-name-ie }, { -brand-name-microsoft } learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made { -brand-name-edge } available for { -brand-name-mac } and { -brand-name-android }.

compare-edge-aside-from-sucking-up-a-lot = Aside from sucking up a lot of computing power, { -brand-name-edge } running on { -brand-name-chromium } has answered a lot of users’ needs for functionality and features. But there’s still a lot to account for in terms of the browser’s privacy protections. It’s our assessment that { -brand-name-firefox } is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-mozilla }</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.
compare-edge-the-bottom-line-is-that-while = The bottom line is that while we suggest using { -brand-name-firefox }, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
