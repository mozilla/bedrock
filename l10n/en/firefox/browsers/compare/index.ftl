# HTML page description
compare-index-a-great-internet-browser-should = A great internet browser should have the functionality you need, portability across devices, and the privacy you deserve.
compare-index-which-browser-is-best-at-keeping = Which browser is best at keeping things confidential?
compare-index-its-not-unreasonable-to-expect = It’s not unreasonable to expect a high level of data protection and privacy from the products we regularly use to get online. At a minimum, a browser should offer some version of “private browsing mode” that automatically deletes your history and search history so other users on the same computer can’t access it. In this area, all seven of the browsers compared here score points.

In this area, all six of the browsers compared here score points.
compare-index-what-you-do-online-literally = What you do online literally shouldn’t be anyone else’s business.
compare-index-another-browser-feature-that = Another browser feature that should be a given is the ability to prevent websites and companies from tracking your browsing and shopping data — even in normal browsing mode.
compare-index-another-browser-feature-fallback = Another browser feature that should be a given is the ability to prevent websites and companies from tracking your browsing and shopping data — even in normal browsing mode. But that’s actually not the case: in fact, the only browsers that block third party tracking cookies by default are { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-safari }.
compare-index-using-a-browser-that-blocks = Using a browser that blocks third-party trackers isn’t just important for privacy — it usually means it runs much faster, too. Most trackers are just scripts that run in the background on a number of websites. You can’t see them, but you can feel them slowing down your browser. As of version 67 of { -brand-name-firefox }, fingerprinting and cryptominers are also blocked. If you’re not familiar with cryptominers, here’s an example of how they can affect you: maybe you’ve experienced your computer suddenly running hotter or the battery depleting faster than normal. That’s often the byproduct of cryptominers creeping around on your device.
compare-index-what-has-your-browser-done = What has your browser done for you lately?
compare-index-in-addition-to-privacy-protection = In addition to privacy protection, which largely takes place in the background of the browser, another key ingredient to a well-made browser is the actual user interface and functionality. Almost all seven browsers are equal when it comes to tab browsing, bookmark management, auto-completion, proofreading and extensions. { -brand-name-firefox }, { -brand-name-edge } and { -brand-name-opera } also offer a quick screenshot function that proves to be quite handy and is definitely something you notice is missing when you switch over to a browser without it.

compare-index-how-well-does-your-browser = How well does your browser work across your devices?
compare-index-almost-all-of-the-browsers = Almost all of the browsers compared here allow synchronization between desktop and mobile devices. You’ll need an account to do it, which you can use to log into the browser on all devices and synchronize things like passwords, browsing history, bookmarks and settings.
compare-index-conclusion = Conclusion:
compare-index-and-the-winner-is = And the winner is…
