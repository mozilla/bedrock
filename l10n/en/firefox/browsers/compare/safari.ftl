# HTML page title
compare-safari-firefox-vs-safari-which-is = { -brand-name-firefox } vs. { -brand-name-safari }: Which is the better browser for you?

# HTML page description.
compare-safari-safari-is-the-pre-installed = { -brand-name-safari } is the pre-installed browser on { -brand-name-mac } and { -brand-name-iphone }. Compare { -brand-name-safari } to the { -brand-name-firefox-browser } to find out which is the better browser for you.

# Main title.
compare-safari-comparing-firefox-browser = Comparing { -brand-name-firefox-browser } with { -brand-name-apple } { -brand-name-safari }

# "Mac" is a brand name, used here as informal shorthand for "macOS computer".
compare-safari-if-you-use-a-mac-or-have = If you use a Mac or have an { -brand-name-iphone }, chances are you’re familiar with the { -brand-name-safari } web browser. The fact that it’s pre-installed as the default browser for { -brand-name-apple } product users definitely gives it an early advantage, but { -brand-name-firefox } has its own set of useful features that make it an attractive alternative. Here we’ll explore the main differences between our browser and { -brand-name-safari } in terms of privacy, utility, and portability between devices.

# A "white hot topic" is something a lot of people are talking about. "Interwebs" is a slang term for the web. Alternative: "web".
compare-safari-privacy-has-become-a-white = Privacy has become a white hot topic for tech companies as they realize more and more people are feeling vulnerable to things like data breaches, ad trackers and hackers. But when it comes down to the real tools people use to navigate the actual interwebs, is it all talk or are they actually taking action to keep your data secure?
compare-safari-as-alluded-to-before-apple-fallback = As alluded to before, { -brand-name-apple } is one of those companies that recently decided to step up their privacy game. Not long ago, { -brand-name-apple } implemented cross-site tracking prevention in { -brand-name-safari }, which prevents ads from following you around the internet. { -brand-name-safari } also offers a strong password suggestion when you sign up for a new account on any website. And if you’re invested in the iCloud ecosystem, it syncs that password securely with your other devices, so you never actually have to remember it.

# "Standing on the soap box" means trying to spread a persuasive message to the masses. Alternative: "We've been spreading the message about privacy for a long time." Soap used to come in wooden crates, and this idiom refers to activists or preachers who would stand on an empty soap box on a street corner to speak to a crowd.
compare-safari-like-safari-we-at-firefox = Like { -brand-name-safari }, we at { -brand-name-firefox } have made a point of focusing on privacy and security. But unlike { -brand-name-safari }, we’ve been standing on the privacy soap box for a long time. In fact, { -brand-name-mozilla } (our parent company) was one of the first voices in the tech community to sound the alarm for online privacy.

# Variables:
#   $attrs (string) - link to https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/facebook-container/ with additional attributes for analytics
# "WebMD" is a brand name.
compare-safari-our-private-browsing-mode = Our Private Browsing mode blocks trackers and erases your passwords, cookies and history every time you close it. But you can also experience our advanced privacy features even in regular browsing mode. With the latest edition of { -brand-name-firefox }, enhanced tracking prevention is turned on by default. This prevents things like cross-site trackers from following you as you jump around the web. Also, with { -brand-name-facebook } being caught out almost daily for privacy problems, our <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-facebook-container }</a> extension makes a lot of sense. It makes it harder for { -brand-name-facebook } to track you around the web — similar to what { -brand-name-safari } does to prevent cross-site tracking — but { -brand-name-firefox } actually isolates your { -brand-name-facebook } session into a separate container blocking { -brand-name-facebook } from tracking what you do on other websites. Why do they need to know what you look up on WebMD anyway?

compare-safari-if-you-choose-to-use-safari = If you choose to use { -brand-name-safari }, you’re in safe hands as long as you’re using an { -brand-name-apple } device. But { -brand-name-safari } only works on { -brand-name-apple } devices, whereas { -brand-name-firefox } works on { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, { -brand-name-ios }, { -brand-name-android } and { -brand-name-linux }.

compare-safari-in-addition-to-the-regular = In addition to the regular set of features you’d expect in a browser, such as tabbed browsing and private browsing, { -brand-name-safari } has some unexpected features as well.

Screenshots is a feature built right into the { -brand-name-firefox } browser, allowing you to copy or download any or all part of a web page. When you save the screenshot, you can also choose which folder you want to find it in, instead of cluttering your desktop. The { -brand-name-pocket } for { -brand-name-firefox } button lets you save web pages and videos to { -brand-name-pocket } in just one click, so you can read a clean, distraction-free version whenever and wherever you want — even offline.

# "iCloud" is a brand name.
compare-safari-firefox-and-safari-both-provide = { -brand-name-firefox } and { -brand-name-safari } both provide a seamless experience when moving from desktop to mobile browsing or vice versa. For { -brand-name-safari }, one of its main strengths is its continuity features. It syncs your bookmarks, tabs, history and more to iCloud so they’re available on all your devices. That means you can open a tab on your { -brand-name-iphone } and have it also appear on your { -brand-name-mac } laptop with just a click.
compare-safari-both-browsers-have-a-lot = Both browsers have a lot of crossover features, as well as some unique functions. It’s worth mentioning, if you take a lot of screenshots, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without this handy feature that’s built right into { -brand-name-firefox }. But if you’re just looking for a fast, private browser for surfing and shopping, then you may want to give { -brand-name-firefox } a try — especially if you’ve been exclusively using { -brand-name-safari } because it came preloaded as the default browser on your computer.

#   $attrs (string) - link to /firefox/accounts/ with additional attributes for analytics

compare-safari-since-safari-is-apples-proprietary = Since { -brand-name-safari } is { -brand-name-apple }’s proprietary web browser, its iCloud syncing works exclusively with { -brand-name-apple } products. This can be somewhat limiting if, for example, you’re both an { -brand-name-android } user and an { -brand-name-iphone } user or if you have a { -brand-name-windows } based PC for work but use an { -brand-name-iphone } as your personal device.

# Variables:

compare-safari-in-the-end-it-just-boils = In the end, it just boils down to what you value in your browser. If you’re integrated with the { -brand-name-apple } ecosystem, { -brand-name-safari } is still a great choice. But if you value having the latest and greatest privacy protections and being able to work across multiple operating systems, we think { -brand-name-firefox } is your best bet. { -brand-name-firefox } is also a solid option as a secondary browser for those { -brand-name-apple }-exclusive users who may want to switch into a different browser for those online moments that call for extra layers of privacy protection.
