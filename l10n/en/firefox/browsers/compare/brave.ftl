compare-brave-firefox-vs-brave-which-is = { -brand-name-firefox } vs. { -brand-name-brave }: Which is the better browser for you?

# HTML page description
compare-brave-compare-brave-to-the-firefox = Compare { -brand-name-brave } to the { -brand-name-firefox-browser } to find out which is the better browser for you in terms of privacy, utility and portability.

# Main title
compare-brave-comparing-firefox-browser = Comparing { -brand-name-firefox-browser } to { -brand-name-brave }

# "Brave Software" is a brand name.
compare-brave-just-like-the-firefox-browser = Just like the { -brand-name-firefox } browser, the { -brand-name-brave } browser is free, open source and focused on protecting users’ privacy. { -brand-name-brave } is a relative newcomer to the world of browsers: its maker, { -brand-name-brave } Software, first debuted the browser in January 2016. In this article we’ll compare our { -brand-name-firefox } browser with the { -brand-name-brave } browser in three categories: privacy, utility and portability.

# To "piggy-back" means to ride on someone's back or shoulders, and here means that open source software builds upon the work of others.
# Variables:
#   $opera (string) - link to /firefox/browsers/compare/opera/ with additional attributes for analytics
#   $edge (string) - link to /firefox/browsers/compare/edge/ with additional attributes for analytics
compare-brave-the-brave-browser-like-so = The { -brand-name-brave } browser, like so many others, is built on the open-source { -brand-name-chromium } code by { -brand-name-google }. Open-source means anyone can use the source code and piggy-back on top of it to build whatever they want — like the <a { $opera }>{ -brand-name-opera }</a> and <a { $edge }>{ -brand-name-edge }</a> browsers. But it doesn’t mean that all { -brand-name-chromium }-based browsers are equal or are themselves open source.

compare-brave-brave-differentiates-itself = { -brand-name-brave } differentiates itself from the other { -brand-name-chromium } browsers by focusing on user privacy — specifically by blocking trackers, scripts, and ads by default. So when you use the { -brand-name-brave } browser, the areas of a website that would normally display ads appear as blank spaces. In some instances, pages don’t load properly, which will require you to either choose a different browser or flip the ‘Shields Up’ setting to ‘Shields Down’ which turns off the privacy and security protection.

# "Basic Attention Token" and "BAT" are brand names. "a.k.a." is an abbreviation of "also known as".
compare-brave-the-internet-as-a-whole-is = The Internet as a whole is largely paid for by display advertisements, which keeps the actual content you want to view free. { -brand-name-brave } has attempted to upend this model by encouraging its users to opt into { -brand-name-brave }’s own reward system, which in reality, is its own ad platform. Once a user has opted-in, { -brand-name-brave } will display what they call “privacy-respecting ads” for which you can view and earn what they call a Basic Attention Token a.k.a. a BAT. From this point { -brand-name-brave } users can choose to spend their BATs on supporting the sites or individual contributors they love, who in turn can convert the BATs into actual currency.
compare-brave-whether-this-sounds-complicated = Whether this sounds complicated or like a great idea, probably depends on your level of contempt for the display advertising on the Internet. Most Internet users understand that good content costs money, and are okay with the fact that the money comes from advertising.

# Variables:
#   $attrs (string) - link to https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/ with additional attributes for analytics
compare-brave-on-the-other-side-of-the-coin = On the other side of the coin, with the { -brand-name-firefox } browser, we prefer to keep things simple. { -brand-name-firefox } blocks many third party trackers, cryptominers and fingerprinting trackers from following you by default. However, { -brand-name-firefox }, outside of Private Browsing Mode, chooses not to block display ads from appearing. That is, unless you install <a { $attrs }>one of the extensions specifically designed for that purpose</a>.

# Variables:
#   $lockwise (string) - link to /firefox/lockwise/ with additional attributes for analytics
#   $extension (string) - link to https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/https-everywhere/ with additional attributes for analytics
#   $privacy (string) - link to /firefox/privacy/products/ with additional attributes for analytics
compare-brave-there-are-a-few-of-braves = There are a few security features in { -brand-name-brave } worth highlighting, such as its automatic HTTPS connection upgrades (which { -brand-name-firefox } also offers by <a { $extension }>extension</a>). { -brand-name-brave } and { -brand-name-firefox } both offer users a native <a { $lockwise }>password manager</a> and the ability to check their security statistics anytime. { -brand-name-brave } displays stats like the number of trackers it has blocked whenever you open a new tab. { -brand-name-firefox } displays similar information when you view <a { $privacy }>your privacy report</a> which can be accessed anytime by clicking the shield in the address bar.

# "Basic Attention Token" is a brand name.
compare-brave-the-bottom-line-is-that-even = The bottom line is that even though { -brand-name-brave }’s revenue model with the Basic Attention Tokens may be too complex for a lot of users, overall both { -brand-name-brave } and { -brand-name-firefox } browsers offer a variety of ways to enjoy a safe and private browsing experience.
compare-brave-what-might-surprise-some-new = What might surprise some new { -brand-name-brave } users is just how fast pages tend to load in the browser. The reason for these speedy load times is that pages load much quicker when you block all of the advertising on them. There’s simply less to load so it takes less time.
compare-brave-in-terms-of-actual-precious = In terms of actual precious RAM usage, the { -brand-name-brave } browser is much heavier than { -brand-name-firefox }. { -brand-name-brave } comes pre-loaded with various features and “add-ons” which can be attributed to its usage of more RAM. { -brand-name-firefox }, on the other hand, lets you decide which add-ons and extensions you want to bolt on.

# Variables:

compare-brave-the-ability-to-sync-your-passwords = The ability to sync your passwords, extensions, form data, add-ons and other preferences across all your devices and operating systems is a feature that’s been available for years with { -brand-name-firefox }. The synced data is also encrypted, which means no one can access it from the outside.

# Variables:
#   $accounts (string) - link to /firefox/accounts/ with additional attributes for analytics
#   $monitor (string) - link to monitor.firefox.com with additional attributes for analytics
#   $breaches (string) - link to monitor.firefox.com/breaches with additional attributes for analytics
compare-brave-the-firefox-browser-also-gives = The { -brand-name-firefox } browser also gives users the ability to sign up for a free <a { $accounts }>{ -brand-name-firefox-account }</a>. Having a { -brand-name-firefox } account is the key to unlocking syncing across devices, plus you get the added benefit of products like <a { $monitor }>{ -brand-name-firefox-monitor }</a> which monitors your email addresses and alerts you if any of your information has been involved in any known <a { $breaches }>data breaches</a>.

compare-brave-overall-brave-is-a-fast-and = Overall, { -brand-name-brave } is a fast and secure browser that will have particular appeal to cryptocurrency users. But for the vast majority of internet citizens, { -brand-name-firefox } remains a better and simpler solution.
compare-brave-braves-advertising-replacement = { -brand-name-brave }’s advertising replacement idea is a twist on the current model of paid ad placement and paid search. But again, some busy Internet users will probably not want to get too involved with the management of micro payments to sites in exchange for their time and attention.
