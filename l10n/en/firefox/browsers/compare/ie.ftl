# HTML page description

# Main title
compare-ie-comparing-firefox-browser-with = Comparing { -brand-name-firefox-browser } with { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-ie }
compare-ie-while-microsofts-internet-explorer = While { -brand-name-microsoft }’s { -brand-name-ie } still comes pre-installed on most Windows-based PCs, clearly { -brand-name-microsoft } would prefer you to use their { -brand-name-edge } browser, which is set as the default when you purchase.
compare-ie-microsoft-discontinued-its-internet = { -brand-name-microsoft } discontinued its { -brand-name-ie } brand several years ago, in favor of its updated { -brand-name-edge } browser for { -brand-name-windows } 10. However, slow adoption for { -brand-name-edge } created room for { -brand-name-ie } to live on, mainly for business compatibility reasons.
compare-ie-here-well-compare-our-firefox = Here we’ll compare our { -brand-name-firefox-browser } with { -brand-name-ie } in terms of security, utility, and portability. We’ll help you understand the differences between how a modern browser like { -brand-name-firefox } that adheres to web standards compares with the browser you may be using for business purposes or out of old habits that die hard.

# Variables:

compare-ie-if-you-havent-moved-on-from-using = If you haven’t moved on from using { -brand-name-ie }, the security risk factor alone should be enough to convince you. <a { $attrs }>{ -brand-name-microsoft }’s own security chief has warned</a> millions of people who continue to use { -brand-name-ie } as their main web browser that they are placing themselves in “peril.”
compare-ie-microsoft-is-no-longer-supporting = { -brand-name-microsoft } is no longer supporting new development for { -brand-name-ie }, which means security concerns are rampant. { -brand-name-microsoft } openly acknowledges the fact that vulnerabilities exist within basically every version of { -brand-name-ie }.

# Variables:

compare-ie-so-whats-the-solution-if-your = So what’s the solution if your company is running legacy apps that only work on { -brand-name-ie }? Our best advice is, don’t mix business with pleasure. We actually recommend use of the <a { $attrs }>Legacy Browser Support extension</a> for { -brand-name-windows }. This extension lets users automatically open a predefined set of URLs in { -brand-name-ie } and switch back to { -brand-name-firefox } when navigating to a different domain.

compare-ie-so-whats-the-solution-if-your-fallback = So what’s the solution if your company is running outdated apps that only work on { -brand-name-ie }? Our best advice for you personally is, don’t mix business with pleasure. The simple thing to do is download and use a more secure browser like { -brand-name-firefox }. Then, if you need to do things like check your personal email or shop online, you can just switch over to the more secure browser. The bottom line is, if { -brand-name-microsoft } is warning people not to use { -brand-name-ie }, don’t use it. Your online privacy and security are not worth risking because you (or your company) have a hard time breaking an old habit. We make { -brand-name-firefox } with security and privacy features like <a { $lockwise }>{ -brand-name-lockwise }</a>, our password manager, private browsing and lots of other add-ons that help us make the web safer for you. Also, our <a { $privacy }>Privacy Policy</a> is straightforward: we tell you what we know about you, and why we collect that information. All of these things obviously go beyond what { -brand-name-ie } offers, and even what other modern browsers like { -brand-name-google } { -brand-name-chrome } and { -brand-name-microsoft } { -brand-name-edge } offer.

compare-ie-alarmingly-4-to-5-of-all-desktop = Alarmingly, 4 to 5% of all desktop web traffic came through { -brand-name-ie } as recently as 2019. That might not seem like a lot, but in reality it means millions of people are being served a poor internet experience with slow loading and rendering times, pages that won’t display properly — all on top of the security issues already discussed.

compare-ie-really-the-only-reasons-to-use = Really the only reasons to use { -brand-name-ie } are for developers to test what their sites look like on an older browser or if a company has business-critical apps that only work with the { -brand-name-ie } browser.

Our unified search and web address bar, or <em>Quantum Bar</em> as we call it, also gives you suggestions based on your existing bookmarks and tags, history, open tabs and popular searches.

# "sunset" here means Microsoft is officially ending production of Internet Explorer. Alternative: "retire"
compare-ie-as-microsoft-has-made-the-move = As { -brand-name-microsoft } has made the move to sunset the { -brand-name-ie } browser, it no longer supports any version for { -brand-name-ios }, and has never been available for { -brand-name-android }. Which means unless you’re running a Windows-based laptop or desktop, you won’t have access to your bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, and other information that modern browsers sync across devices.
compare-ie-firefox-works-on-any-platform = { -brand-name-firefox } works on any platform, including { -brand-name-windows }, { -brand-name-mac }, { -brand-name-linux }, { -brand-name-android } and { -brand-name-ios }. Which also means you can sync all your information across platforms. So if you’re browsing on a { -brand-name-windows }-based laptop, you can pick up where you left off when you move to browsing on your { -brand-name-iphone } or { -brand-name-android } device. This convenience should come standard with any modern web browser, and is sorely lacking with { -brand-name-ie }.
compare-ie-there-was-a-time-not-so-long = There was a time not so long ago where { -brand-name-ie } was the most popular and widely used browser in the world. Times have changed and so has technology, but unfortunately { -brand-name-ie } has pretty much stayed the same. { -brand-name-microsoft } itself openly implores users to stop using { -brand-name-ie } and instead switch to their newer { -brand-name-chromium }-based { -brand-name-edge } browser.

compare-ie-our-opinion-is-just-to-go-with = Our opinion is just to go with a trusted, private browser with a track record of delivering a great experience across devices. In a head-to-head comparison, it’s really no contest at all. { -brand-name-firefox } is hands down the winner across all assessment categories. If you do find yourself at Nana’s house firing up { -brand-name-ie }, maybe you want to do Nana a favor and <a { $attrs }>download { -brand-name-firefox }</a> for her.
