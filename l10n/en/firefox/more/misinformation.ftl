misinformation-brand-firefox-browser = { -brand-name-firefox-browser }
misinformation-page-title = Avoid misinformation online – { -brand-name-firefox } is here to help
misinformation-page-desc = Misinformation is annoying, distracting and expensive. { -brand-name-firefox } has some tips for avoiding false information – and seeing less of it when browsing the web.
misinformation-page-subheading = Check out tips for seeing less misinformation and focusing on what’s important to you
misinformation-what-is-heading = What is misinformation? What is disinformation?
misinformation-disinformation = Misinformation, disinformation – you’ve probably heard these terms in the past and wondered if and how they differ in meaning. It’s the intention that distinguishes them: Misinformation is any type of false information that people might fall for. It’s verifiably incorrect or misleading but hasn’t been created or shared with the intention to deceive people. Disinformation, on the other hand, is created and spread in order to misinform and reach a certain goal.
misinformation-ultimately-harmful = Ultimately, both misinformation and disinformation can be harmful. It’s not only that people will believe incorrect information, false information costs the global economy a lot of money and can threaten democracy and efficient governance. And it’s difficult to stop because false news spreads significantly faster, deeper and more broadly than news that is correct.
misinformation-false-info-heading = Where does false information show up?

# Variables:
#   $tracking (url) - link to https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-privacy-protections/
misinformation-widespread-online = You can come across misinformation and disinformation everywhere but it is most widespread and impactful when shared online. Algorithms and <a href="{ $tracking }">tracking</a> have increased the ability for misinformation and disinformation to reach a larger audience on websites, blogs, forums and social networks.

misinformation-tracking-advertising = You may have heard about tracking primarily in the context of advertising. However, it’s also a powerful tool when it comes to the spread of false information. Why is that? When you browse the internet or your social network feed, your behavior, interests, contacts in some instances and more are tracked by various parties across websites in order to create an extremely detailed profile of you to sell to others without your knowledge or consent. These profiles are used for personalized advertising but can also serve to present any kind of targeted information to you.
misinformation-social-newtorks = When you receive content recommendations on any website or social network, it’s often because an algorithm presents information based on your profile information. Unfortunately, although algorithms are getting smarter and smarter, they don’t check content for accuracy. This is particularly problematic with social media: These networks surface countless pieces of information for their users every day and have access to almost unlimited content including user posts, news articles, ads and sponsored content. While posts and articles may accidentally spread misinformation, ads and sponsored content can be used to target you deliberately with disinformation to manipulate you, making it essential you know how to identify misinformation.

misinformation-look-at-url = Look at the URL and/or the source.

misinformation-overly-sensational = Is the headline overly sensational?
misinformation-check-out-websites = Check out websites and news outlets that you trust to see if and how they report on the same topic. Content that is intended to manipulate will often use extremes and exaggerations for which there is no evidence and will not be found in well-researched reporting.
misinformation-content-up-to-date = Is the content up to date?
misinformation-outdated-information = Outdated information is not necessarily meant to disinform, but it may not be factually correct any longer.

misinformation-how-firefox-helps-heading = How { -brand-name-firefox } helps you avoid misinformation
misinformation-firefox-keeps-trackers-heading = { -brand-name-firefox } keeps trackers in check:

# Variables:
#   $firefox (url) - link to https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/
#   $protection (url) - link to https://support.mozilla.org/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop
misinformation-firefox-keeps-trackers-desc = As mentioned before, tracking plays a big role in the spread of misinformation. <a href="{ $firefox }">Using { -brand-name-firefox }</a> with <a href="{ $protection }">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> helps by blocking third-party trackers from many advertisers and other players by default when you browse the web, so that you gain back control over your online data.

# Variables:

misinformation-social-media-clean-desc = Social networks know a lot about you. Plus, they’re able to track you beyond their platforms with their Share and Like buttons despite Tracking Protection — even if you don’t have an account. The <a href="{ $container }">{ -brand-name-facebook-container }</a> for { -brand-name-firefox } makes sure that { -brand-name-facebook } and { -brand-name-instagram } can’t do this so easily, which again reduces the probability of seeing misinformation via ads and promoted content significantly.

# Variables:
#   $foundation (url) - link to https://www.mozillafoundation.org/
