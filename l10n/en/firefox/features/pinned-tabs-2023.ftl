# HTML page description
pinned-tabs-keep-your-favorite-pages-open = Keep your favorite pages open and just a click away. Use Pinned Tabs to keep an eye on your email or messaging apps.

pinned-tabs-pinning-a-tab-in-firefox-allows = Pinning a tab in { -brand-name-firefox } allows you to keep your favorite sites always open and a click away. They’ll open automatically when you start { -brand-name-firefox }. We’ve found them especially useful for keeping things like email and calendar websites always at hand.
pinned-tabs-theyre-small-and-you-cant-close = They’re small, and you can’t close them accidentally because they don’t have a close button. Instead, you have to unpin them.
pinned-tabs-you-can-see-when-your-pinned-tabs = You can see when your pinned tabs are updated, for example, if you get a new email or direct message.
pinned-tabs-if-you-click-on-a-link-within = If you click on a link from within your pinned tab, { -brand-name-firefox } will automatically open the link in a separate, new tab so your pinned tab lives on forever (or until you unpin it).
