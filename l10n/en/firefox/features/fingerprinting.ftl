features-fingerprinting-fingerprinting-is-a = Fingerprinting is a type of online tracking that’s more invasive than ordinary cookie-based tracking. A digital fingerprint is created when a company makes a unique profile of you based on your computer hardware, software, add-ons, and even preferences. Your settings like the screen you use, the fonts installed on your computer, and even your choice of a web browser can all be used to create a fingerprint.
features-fingerprinting-if-you-have = If you have a commonly used laptop, PC or smartphone, it may be harder to uniquely identify your device through fingerprinting. However, the more unique add-ons, fonts, and settings you have, the easier you’ll be likely to find. Companies can use this unique combination of information to create your fingerprint. That's why { -brand-name-firefox } blocks known fingerprinting, so you can still use your favorite extensions, themes and customization without being followed by ads.
features-fingerprinting-fingerprinting-is-bad = Fingerprinting is bad for the web
