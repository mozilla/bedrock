privacy-faq-we-stand-for-people-over-profit = We Stand for People Over Profit.
privacy-faq-it-can-be-tricky-for-people = It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for { -brand-name-firefox }, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
privacy-faq-at-mozilla-we-respect-and-protect = At { -brand-name-mozilla }, we respect and protect your personal information:

# Variables:

privacy-faq-we-follow-a-set-of-data-privacy = We follow a set of <a href="{ $link }">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the { -brand-name-firefox } desktop and mobile browsers.
privacy-faq-we-only-collect-the-data-we = We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
privacy-faq-we-put-people-in-control-of = We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
privacy-faq-we-adhere-to-no-surprises-principle = We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of { -brand-name-firefox } matches reality.

privacy-faq-i-use-firefox-for-almost-everything = I use { -brand-name-firefox } for almost everything on the web. You folks at { -brand-name-mozilla } must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
privacy-faq-firefox-the-web-browser-that = { -brand-name-firefox }, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. { -brand-name-mozilla }, the company that makes { -brand-name-firefox }, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
privacy-faq-really-you-dont-collect-my-browsing = Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?

# Variables:
#   $link (url) - link to https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-pioneer/
privacy-faq-mozilla-doesnt-know-as-much = { -brand-name-mozilla } doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="{ $link }">{ -brand-name-firefox } Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across { -brand-name-firefox } installations, we don’t know what that history is — because it’s encrypted by your device.
privacy-faq-it-seems-like-every-company = It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.

You can learn more about how we make money in our <a href="{ $link }">annual financial report</a>.

# A "softball" is a question that is really easy to answer.
privacy-faq-okay-those-first-few-were-softballs = Okay, those first few were softballs. What data do you collect?

# Variables:

privacy-faq-mozilla-does-collect-a-limited = { -brand-name-mozilla } does collect a limited set of data by default from { -brand-name-firefox } that helps us to understand how people use the browser.

For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

privacy-faq-if-we-dont-know-how-the-browser = If we don’t know how the browser is performing or which features people use, we can’t make it better and deliver the great product you want.
