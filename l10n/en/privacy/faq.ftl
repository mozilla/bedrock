privacy-faq-we-stand-for-people-over-profit = We Stand for People Over Profit.
privacy-faq-it-can-be-tricky-for-people = It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for { -brand-name-firefox }, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
privacy-faq-at-mozilla-we-respect-and-protect = At { -brand-name-mozilla }, we respect and protect your personal information:

privacy-faq-firefox-the-web-browser-that-v2 = { -brand-name-firefox }, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information generally stays on your device. { -brand-name-mozilla }, the company that makes { -brand-name-firefox }, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
privacy-faq-really-you-dont-collect-my-browsing = Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
privacy-faq-mozilla-doesnt-know-as-much-v2 = { -brand-name-mozilla } doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, which allow interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across { -brand-name-firefox } installations, we don’t know what that history is — because it’s encrypted by your device.

For example, we collect this data through the back button (that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage) in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

privacy-faq-if-we-dont-know-how-the-browser = If we don’t know how the browser is performing or which features people use, we can’t make it better and deliver the great product you want.
